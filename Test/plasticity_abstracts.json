 "AbstractText": "Most legume species establish a symbiotic association with soil bacteria. The plant accommodates the differentiated rhizobia in specialized organs, the root nodules. In this environment, the microsymbiont reduces atmospheric nitrogen (N) making it available for plant metabolism. Symbiotic N-fixation is driven by the respiration of the host photosynthates and thus constitutes an additional carbon sink for the plant. Molecular phenotypes of symbiotic and non-symbiotic Medicago truncatula are identified. The implication of nodule symbiosis on plant abiotic stress response mechanisms is not well understood. In this study, we exposed nodulated and non-symbiotic N-fertilized plants to salt and drought conditions. We assessed the stress effects with proteomic and metabolomic methods and found a nutritionally regulated phenotypic plasticity pivotal for a differential stress adjustment strategy."

 "AbstractText": "Sunlight, the ultimate energy source for life on our planet, enters the biosphere as a direct consequence of the evolution of photoautotrophy. Photoautotrophs must balance the light energy absorbed and trapped through extremely fast, temperature-insensitive photochemistry with energy consumed through much slower, temperature-dependent biochemistry and metabolism. The attainment of such a balance in cellular energy flow between chloroplasts, mitochondria and the cytosol is called photostasis. Photoautotrophs sense cellular energy imbalances through modulation of excitation pressure which is a measure of the relative redox state of Q(A), the first stable quinone electron acceptor of photosystem II reaction centers. High excitation pressure constitutes a potential stress condition that can be caused either by exposure to an irradiance that exceeds the capacity of C, N, and S assimilation to utilize the electrons generated from the absorbed energy or by low temperature or any stress that decreases the capacity of the metabolic pathways downstream of photochemistry to utilize photosynthetically generated reductants. The similarities and differences in the phenotypic responses between cyanobacteria, green algae, crop plants, and variegation mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana as a function of cold acclimation and photoacclimation are reconciled in terms of differential responses to excitation pressure and the predisposition of photoautotrophs to maintain photostasis. The various acclimation strategies associated with green algae and cyanobacteria versus winter cereals and A. thaliana are discussed in terms of retrograde regulation and the \"grand design of photosynthesis\" originally proposed by Arnon (1982)."

 "AbstractText": "(1) The effects of facilitation on the structure and dynamics of plant populations have not been studied so widely as competition. The UV-B radiation, as a typical environmental factor causing stress, may result in direct stress and facilitation. (2) The effects of UV-B radiation on intraspecific competition and facilitation were investigated based on the following three predictions on self-thinning, size inequality, and phenotypic plasticity: i) Self-thinning is the reduction in density that results from the increase in the mean biomass of individuals in crowded populations, and is driven by competition. In this study, the mortality rate of the population is predicted to decrease from UV-B irradiance. ii) The size inequality of a population increases with competition intensity because larger individuals receive a disproportionate share of resources, thereby leaving limited resources for smaller individuals. The second hypothesis assumes that direct stress decreases the size inequality of the population. iii) Phenotypic plasticity is the ability to alter one's morphology in response to environmental changes. The third hypothesis assumes that certain morphological indices can change among the trade-offs between competition, facilitation, and stress. These predictions were tested by conducting a field pot experiment using mung beans, and were supported by the following results: (3) UV-B radiation increased the survival rate of the population at the end of self-thinning. However, this result was mainly due to direct stress rather than facilitation. (4) Just as competitor, facilitation was also asymmetric. It increased the size inequality of populations during self-thinning, whereas stress decreased the size inequality. (5) Direct stress and facilitation influence plants differently on various scales. Stress inhibited plant growth, whereas facilitation showed the opposite on an individual scale. Stress increased survival rate, whereas facilitation increased individual variability on the population scale. (6) Trade-offs between competitions, facilitation, and direct stress varied in different growing stages."

 "AbstractText": "• Premise of the study: The European Alps harbor a spatially heterogeneous environment. Plants can be adapted genetically to this heterogeneity but may also respond to it by phenotypic plasticity. We expected the important fodder grass Poa alpina to be adapted to elevation either genetically or plastically. • Methods: We investigated in three elevational common gardens whether growth and reproductive allocation of plants reproducing either by seeds or bulbils suggest adaptation to their elevation of origin and to what extent they can respond plastically to different elevations. Additionally, we analyzed genetic diversity using microsatellites and tested whether seeds are of sexual origin. • Key results: In the field, bulbil-producing plants occurred more often at higher elevations, whereas seed-producing plants occurred more often at lower elevations, but bulbil-producing plants were generally less vigorous in the common gardens. The response of plants to elevational transplantation was highly plastic, and vigor was always best at the highest location. The small genetic differences were not clinally related to elevation of origin, underlining the importance of phenotypic plasticity. Reproductive allocation was, however, independent of elevational treatments. Seed-producing plants had higher genetic diversity than the bulbil-producing plants even though we found that seed-producing plants were facultative apomicts mostly reproducing asexually. • Conclusions: Bulbil-producing P. alpina, showing a fitness cost at lower elevations compared with seed-producing plants, seem better adapted to higher elevations. By means of its two reproductive modes and the capacity to adjust plastically, P. alpina is able to occupy a broad ecological niche across a large elevational range."

 "AbstractText": "• Premise of the study: Environments are composed of selective agents, and environments may also modify the efficacy of these agents. Environments affect the rate of maximum evolutionary change by influencing variation in relative fitness (i.e., the opportunity for selection, or I). Within- and transgenerational plastic environmental responses may affect I, speeding or slowing processes of local adaptation. • Methods: We determined whether environmental factors affected the opportunity for selection (I) in Aegilops triuncialis (barbed goatgrass) by measuring I as a within- and transgenerational plastic response to two maternal glasshouse environments (serpentine/dry and loam/moist). We also determined whether this species' two most common genetic lineages (determined by DNA microsatellite length polymorphism) varied in response to glasshouse treatments. • Key Results: Opportunity for selection was less for plants grown in the dry serpentine environment than for plants grown in the moist loam environment. This response varied between genetic lineages. The east lineage exhibited a within-generation response to the dry serpentine environment. For both seed mass and average seed weight in this lineage, the opportunity for selection was lower in dry serpentine than in moist loam. The west lineage had a transgenerational response to the dry serpentine such that the opportunity for selection for seed number and seed mass was lower for plants produced by mothers grown in dry serpentine than for plants produced by mothers in moist loam. • Conclusions: Phenotypic variation in relative fitness is constrained by the dry serpentine environment, which leads to lower evolvability in this environment. Within- and transgenerational effects of the environment may slow local adaptation to serpentine soils."

 "AbstractText": "We compared the phenotypic plasticity of two early successional forbs of nutrient-poor mobile dunes (Agriophyllum squarrosum and Corispermum macrocarpum) and two later successional forbs (weeds) of stabilized, higher nutrient dunes and cropland (Chenopodium acuminatum and Salsola collina) to variations in environmental factors. A controlled (including soil nutrients, water, and population density) greenhouse experiment was conducted in Horqin sandy land, China. Late successional species had high plasticity in growth response to nutrients and water or high performance in high soil nutrients and water, reflecting their higher nutrient habitat. In contrast, the early successional species have low plasticity, reflecting their adaptation to resource-poor early successional soil. Late successional species did not always have higher reproductive effort than early successional species. Plants did not have a uniform strategy of increasing reproductive effort with any environmental stressors. Reproductive effort increased with increasing water availability and decreasing nutrient levels, while density had no effect. Patterns of plasticity traits for late successional species exhibited a complex of Master-of-some and Jack-of-all-trades. Late successional species had higher performance or higher plasticity than early successional species."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Efficient and sustainable management of rapidly mounting environmental issues has been the focus of current intensive research. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle."

 "AbstractText": "The question of why some introduced species become invasive and others do not is the central puzzle of invasion biology. Two of the principal explanations for this phenomenon concern functional traits: invasive species may have higher values of competitively advantageous traits than non-invasive species, or they may have greater phenotypic plasticity in traits that permits them to survive the colonization period and spread to a broad range of environments. Although there is a large body of evidence for superiority in particular traits among invasive plants, when compared to phylogenetically related non-invasive plants, it is less clear if invasive plants are more phenotypically plastic, and whether this plasticity confers a fitness advantage. In this study, I used a model group of 10 closely related Pinus species whose invader or non-invader status has been reliably characterized to test the relative contribution of high trait values and high trait plasticity to relative growth rate, a performance measure standing in as a proxy for fitness. When grown at higher nitrogen supply, invaders had a plastic RGR response, increasing their RGR to a much greater extent than non-invaders. However, invasive species did not exhibit significantly more phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species for any of 17 functional traits, and trait plasticity indices were generally weakly correlated with RGR. Conversely, invasive species had higher values than non-invaders for 13 of the 17 traits, including higher leaf area ratio, photosynthetic capacity, photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency, and nutrient uptake rates, and these traits were also strongly correlated with performance. I conclude that, in responding to higher N supply, superior trait values coupled with a moderate degree of trait variation explain invasive species' superior performance better than plasticity per se."

 "text": "Epigenetic marks superimposed on the DNA sequence of eukaryote chromosomes provide agility and plasticity in terms of modulating gene expression, ontology, and response to the environment. Modulating the methylation status of cytosine can generate epialleles, which have been detected and characterised at specific loci in several plant systems, and have the potential to generate novel and relatively stable phenotypes. There have been no systematic attempts to explore and utilise epiallelic variation, and so extend the range of phenotypes available for selection in crop improvement. We developed an approach for generating novel epialleles by perturbation of the DNA methylation status. 5- Azacytidine (5-AzaC) provides selective targeting of 5 mCG, which in plants is associated with exonic DNA. Targeted chemical intervention using 5-AzaC has advantages over transgenic or mutant modulation of methyltransferases, allowing stochastic generation of epialleles across the genome.",

Systematic analysis of dose-response to 5-AzaC in B. rapa guided generation of a selfed stochastically hypomethylated population, used for forward screening of several agronomic traits. Dose-response was sigmoidal for several traits, similar to that observed for chemical mutagens such as EMS. We demonstrated transgenerational inheritance of some phenotypes. BraRoAZ is a unique hypomethylated population of 1000 E2 sib lines. When compared to untreated controls, 5-Aza C-treated lines exhibited reduced immuno-staining of 5mC on pachytene chromosomes, and Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) profiles that were both divergent and more variable. There was coincident phenotypic variation among these lines for a range of seed yield and composition traits, including increased seed protein content and decreased oil content, as well as decreased erucic acid and corresponding increases in linoleic and/or palmitic acid. Each 5-AzaC-treated line represents a unique combination of hypomethylated epialleles.",

 "AbstractText": "The major staple food crops production is not able to fulfill food requirement of the global population due to relatively higher population growth rate in developing countries. The research on these crops for exploring their ultimate yield potential is currently at a plateau level. To replace the existing pressure on these major crops there is an urgent need to explore other alternative crops having the potential to replace and fulfill the available food demand. FAO statistics reveal that there is a high frequency of low birth weight children in the developing countries, which is primarily due to deficiency of micronutrients in the mother's diet. Amaranth, an underutilized crop and a cheap source of proteins, minerals, vitamin A and C, seems to be a future crop which can substantiate this demand due to its tremendous yield potential and nutritional qualities, also recently gained worldwide attention. Recently, current interest in amaranth also resides in the fact that it has a great amount of genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity, and is extremely adaptable to adverse growing conditions, resists heat and drought, has no major disease problem, and is among the easiest of plants to grow in agriculturally marginal lands. The present review is an effort to gather the available knowledge on various diversified fields of sciences for the future exploitation of the crop."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Thellungiella salsuginea is an important model plant due to its natural tolerance to abiotic stresses including salt, cold, and water deficits. Microarray and metabolite profiling have shown that Thellungiella undergoes stress-responsive changes in transcript and organic solute abundance when grown under controlled environmental conditions. However, few reports assess the capacity of plants to display stress-responsive traits in natural habitats where concurrent stresses are the norm. RESULTS: To determine whether stress-responsive changes observed in cabinet-grown plants are recapitulated in the field, we analyzed leaf transcript and metabolic profiles of Thellungiella growing in its native Yukon habitat during two years of contrasting meteorological conditions. We found 673 genes showing differential expression between field and unstressed, chamber-grown plants. There were comparatively few overlaps between genes expressed under field and cabinet treatment-specific conditions. Only 20 of 99 drought-responsive genes were expressed both in the field during a year of low precipitation and in plants subjected to drought treatments in cabinets. There was also a general pattern of lower abundance among metabolites found in field plants relative to control or stress-treated plants in growth cabinets. Nutrient availability may explain some of the observed differences. For example, proline accumulated to high levels in cold and salt-stressed cabinet-grown plants but proline content was, by comparison, negligible in plants at a saline Yukon field site. We show that proline accumulated in a stress-responsive manner in Thellungiella plants salinized in growth cabinets and in salt-stressed seedlings when nitrogen was provided at 1.0 mM. In seedlings grown on 0.1 mM nitrogen medium, the proline content was low while carbohydrates increased. The relatively higher content of sugar-like compounds in field plants and seedlings on low nitrogen media suggests that Thellungiella shows metabolic plasticity in response to environmental stress and that resource availability can influence the expression of stress tolerance traits under field conditions. CONCLUSION: Comparisons between Thellungiella plants responding to stress in cabinets and in their natural habitats showed differences but also overlap between transcript and metabolite profiles. The traits in common offer potential targets for improving crops that must respond appropriately to multiple, concurrent stresses."

 "AbstractText": "Invasive alien species might benefit from phenotypic plasticity by being able to (i) maintain fitness in stressful environments ('robust'), (ii) increase fitness in favourable environments ('opportunistic'), or (iii) combine both abilities ('robust and opportunistic'). Here, we applied this framework, for the first time, to an animal, the invasive slug, Arion lusitanicus, and tested (i) whether it has a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity compared with a congeneric native slug, Arion fuscus, and (ii) whether it is robust, opportunistic or both. During one year, we exposed specimens of both species to a range of temperatures along an altitudinal gradient (700-2400 m a.s.l.) and to high and low food levels, and we compared the responsiveness of two fitness traits: survival and egg production. During summer, the invasive species had a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and at high temperatures and low food levels, it survived better and produced more eggs than A. fuscus, representing the robust phenotype. During winter, A. lusitanicus displayed a less adaptive phenotype than A. fuscus. We show that the framework developed for plants is also very useful for a better mechanistic understanding of animal invasions. Warmer summers and milder winters might lead to an expansion of this invasive species to higher altitudes and enhance its spread in the lowlands, supporting the concern that global climate change will increase biological invasions."

 "AbstractText": "The mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) is a small fish native to mangrove ecosystems in Florida, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. This species is one of only two self-fertilizing, hermaphroditic vertebrates capable of producing offspring that are genetically identical to both the parent and all siblings. Long bouts of selfing result in individuals with completely homozygous genotypes, effectively allowing for the production of \"clones.\" Rivulus is also extremely sensitive to environmental change, both during development and adulthood. Life-history traits, behavior, physiology, morphology, and even sexual phenotype are shaped to a large extent by the interaction of genes with the environment, and many of these traits appear to co-vary. True reaction norms can be generated for this species in much the same way as has been done for clonally reproducing invertebrates and plants that have contributed immensely to our understanding of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. That is, rivulus provides the opportunity to place individuals with identical genotypes in many different environments at any point during ontogeny or adulthood. In addition, rivulus populations are characterized by high genotypic diversity, a luxury not afforded by many clonal vertebrates, which allows us to evaluate variation among genotypes in the shape of reaction norms and in patterns of covariance among traits. We provide background information on phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic integration, coupled with a description of characteristics that we feel qualify rivulus as a potentially powerful model in which to study the evolution of reaction norms and covariance among traits."

 "text": "Knowledge of those traits that vary with latitude should be helpful in predicting how they may evolve locally under climate change. In the sea beet Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima, seed dormancy largely controls the timing of germination, is highly heritable and varies geographically; it is therefore thought to be selected by climate. The aim here was to characterize the variation in seed dormancy among sea beet populations across the French distribution area, as well as the ecological factors in situ that are correlated with and that could therefore select for seed dormancy. The relative importance of genetic inheritance vs. non-genetic variation is also evaluated.",

 "text": "The proportions of dormant seeds in the greenhouse were highly variable, covering almost the entire range from 0 to 1, and followed a geographical pattern from lower dormancy at high latitudes to high dormancy at low latitudes. The distribution of dormancy was positively correlated with yearly temperatures, especially summer temperatures. Minimum temperatures in winter did not significantly explain the trait variation. The genetic component of the total variation was significant and is probably completed by an important adjustment to the local conditions brought about by maternal adaptive phenotypic plasticity.",

 "AbstractText": "The decision to replicate its DNA is of crucial importance for every cell and, in many organisms, is decisive for the progression through the entire cell cycle. A comparison of animals versus yeast has shown that, although most of the involved cell-cycle regulators are divergent in both clades, they fulfill a similar role and the overall network topology of G1/S regulation is highly conserved. Using germline development as a model system, we identified a regulatory cascade controlling entry into S phase in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which, as a member of the Plantae supergroup, is phylogenetically only distantly related to Opisthokonts such as yeast and animals. This module comprises the Arabidopsis homologs of the animal transcription factor E2F, the plant homolog of the animal transcriptional repressor Retinoblastoma (Rb)-related 1 (RBR1), the plant-specific F-box protein F-BOX-LIKE 17 (FBL17), the plant specific cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors KRPs, as well as CDKA;1, the plant homolog of the yeast and animal Cdc2⁺/Cdk1 kinases. Our data show that the principle of a double negative wiring of Rb proteins is highly conserved, likely representing a universal mechanism in eukaryotic cell-cycle control. However, this negative feedback of Rb proteins is differently implemented in plants as it is brought about through a quadruple negative regulation centered around the F-box protein FBL17 that mediates the degradation of CDK inhibitors but is itself directly repressed by Rb. Biomathematical simulations and subsequent experimental confirmation of computational predictions revealed that this regulatory circuit can give rise to hysteresis highlighting the here identified dosage sensitivity of CDK inhibitors in this network."

 "AbstractText": "To better understand the evolution of phenotypic plasticity and thermoregulation and their potential value for ectotherms in the face of global warming, we conducted field experiments to measure their effects on fitness and their association with reproductive phenology in Plantago lanceolata in a thermally variable environment. We measured the reproductive timing and success of genotypes varying in thermoregulation, as mediated by floral-reflectance plasticity. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that thermoregulation is more adaptive when thermally variable reproductive seasons are shorter and cooler. Strong thermoregulation/plasticity increased reproductive success during the cool portion of the reproductive season but not during the warm portion. Directional selection that favored strongly thermoregulating genotypes early in the season shifted to stabilizing selection that favored genotypes with weaker thermoregulation later in the season. Thermoregulation and reproductive phenology were negatively correlated. Although reproductive onset and duration were similar between genotypes, strong thermoregulators produced more and larger spikes (clutches) early; weak thermoregulators produced more spikes late. Results suggest that with atmospheric warming, the benefit of raising body temperature via thermoregulation when it is cool should decline in extant populations. The negative correlation between thermoregulation and phenology should accelerate the evolutionary shift toward thermoconformity, that is, reduced plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Organisms are subject to random changes in their external environments, as well as in their internal components. A central goal of evolutionary systems biology is to understand how living systems cope with-and in some cases exploit-this variation. Many cellular and developmental processes operate with high fidelity to produce stereotyped, irreversible outcomes despite environmental and genetic perturbation. These processes are said to be robust or insensitive to variation. Robustness can lead to single, invariant phenotypes, or it can take the form of phenotypic plasticity, in which different environmental conditions reproducibly induce distinct phenotypes. Some organisms cope with environmental variation not with robust responses but with stochastic, reversible fate decisions. In those organisms, lower robustness yields heterogeneity among individuals, which in turn serves as a bet-hedging mechanism for the population. Considering high-fidelity and bet-hedging processes together-as a robustness continuum-provides a unifying framework for analyzing and conceptualizing variation in complex evolving systems. This framework can be applied to understanding the architectures and dynamics of the regulatory networks that underlie fate decisions in microbes, plants, animals, and cancer cells."

 "AbstractText": "Anthropogenic climate change has already altered the timing of major life-history transitions, such as the initiation of reproduction. Both phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution can underlie rapid phenological shifts in response to climate change, but their relative contributions are poorly understood. Here, we combine a continuous 38 year field survey with quantitative genetic field experiments to assess adaptation in the context of climate change. We focused on Boechera stricta (Brassicaeae), a mustard native to the US Rocky Mountains. Flowering phenology advanced significantly from 1973 to 2011, and was strongly associated with warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt dates. Strong directional selection favoured earlier flowering in contemporary environments (2010-2011). Climate change could drive this directional selection, and promote even earlier flowering as temperatures continue to increase. Our quantitative genetic analyses predict a response to selection of 0.2 to 0.5 days acceleration in flowering per generation, which could account for more than 20 per cent of the phenological change observed in the long-term dataset. However, the strength of directional selection and the predicted evolutionary response are likely much greater now than even 30 years ago because of rapidly changing climatic conditions. We predict that adaptation will likely be necessary for long-term in situ persistence in the context of climate change."

 "text": "Despite general agreement regarding the adaptive importance of plasticity, evidence for the role of environmental resource availability in plants is scarce. In arid and semi-arid environments, the persistence and dominance of perennial species depends on their capacity to tolerate drought: tolerance could be given on one extreme by fixed traits and, on the other, by plastic traits. To understand drought tolerance of species it is necessary to know the plasticity of their water economy-related traits, i.e. the position in the fixed-plastic continuum.",

 "text": "Three conspicuous co-existing perennial grasses from a Patagonian steppe were grown under controlled conditions with four levels of steady-state water availability. Evaluated traits were divided into two groups. The first was associated with potential plant performance and correlated with fitness, and included above-ground biomass, total biomass, tillering and tiller density at harvest. The second group consisted of traits associated with mechanisms of plant adjustment to environmental changes and included root biomass, shoot/root ratio, tiller biomass, length of total elongated leaf, length of yellow tissue divided by time and ﬁnal length divided by the time taken to reach ﬁnal length.",

 "text": "The most plastic species along this drought gradient was the most sensitive to drought, whereas the least plastic and slowest growing was the most tolerant. This negative relationship between tolerance and plasticity was true for fitness-related traits but was trait-dependent for underlying traits. Remarkably, the most tolerant species had the highest positive plasticity (i.e. opposite to the default response to stress) in an underlying trait, directly explaining its drought resistance: it increased absolute root biomass. The niche differentiation axis that allows the coexistence of species in this group of perennial dryland grasses, all limited by soil surface moisture, would be a functional one of fixed versus plastic responses.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "As sessile organisms, plants have to cope with the ever-changing environment as well as with numerous forms of stress. To react to these external cues, plants have evolved a suite of response mechanisms operating at many different levels, ranging from physiological to molecular processes that provide the organism with a wide phenotypic plasticity, allowing for fine tuning of the reactions to these adverse circumstances. During the past decade, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as key regulatory molecules, which contribute to a significant portion of the transcriptome in eukaryotes and are involved in the control of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways. Although accumulated evidence supports an important role for ncRNAs in plant response and adaptation to abiotic stress, their mechanism(s) of action still remains obscure and a functional characterization of the ncRNA repertoire in plants is still needed. Moreover, common features in the biogenesis of different small ncRNAs, and in some cases, cross talk between different gene regulatory pathways may add to the complexity of these pathways and could play important roles in modulating stress responses. Here we review the various ncRNAs that have been reported to participate in the response to abiotic stress in plants, focusing on their importance in plant adaptation and evolution. Understanding how ncRNAs work may reveal novel mechanisms involved in the plant responses to the environment."

In addition, modulation of cell-division rate is an important mechanism of plant plasticity and is key in adapting of plants to environmental conditions. One of the greatest challenges in understanding the cell cycle of flowering plants is the large families of CDKs and cyclins that have the potential to form many different complexes. However, it is largely unclear which complexes are active. In addition, there are many CDK- and cyclin-related proteins whose biological role is still unclear, i.e. whether they have indeed enzymatic activity. Thus, a biochemical characterization of these proteins is of key importance for the understanding of their function.",

 "AbstractText": "Previous studies revealed significant phenotypic plasticity, genetic variability and population differentiation of flower morphometric traits on dwarf bearded iris Iris pumila. Also, study of I. pumila flowering phenology revealed significant impact of habitat type as well as population differentiation for flowering time. Since the flowering time can influence other flower traits, we performed this analysis of flower morphometric traits in three time points during the flower bud ontogenic development in two habitat types (open vs. shaded). Analysis revealed that for most of the traits greater trait values were recorded for open habitat but only on latter time points. For most of the analyzed traits direction of differences in bud stage was the opposite to the direction of differences in mature flower stage detected in previous studies. However, length of the stem, a trait that showed the greatest variability between habitats and populations and therefore greatest genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity, was significantly greater in the samples from the late flowering shaded habitat in all time samples, indicating that in case of this trait different mechanisms were involved. Those findings have implications for design of the future studies on I. pumila."

 "AbstractText": "Heritable epigenetic modulation of gene expression is a candidate mechanism to explain parental environmental effects on offspring phenotypes, but current evidence for environment-induced epigenetic changes that persist in offspring generations is scarce. In apomictic dandelions, exposure to various stresses was previously shown to heritably alter DNA methylation patterns. In this study we explore whether these induced changes are accompanied by heritable effects on offspring phenotypes. We observed effects of parental jasmonic acid treatment on offspring specific leaf area and on offspring interaction with a generalist herbivore; and of parental nutrient stress on offspring root-shoot biomass ratio, tissue P-content and leaf morphology. Some of the effects appeared to enhance offspring ability to cope with the same stresses that their parents experienced. Effects differed between apomictic genotypes and were not always consistently observed between different experiments, especially in the case of parental nutrient stress. While this context-dependency of the effects remains to be further clarified, the total set of results provides evidence for the existence of transgenerational effects in apomictic dandelions. Zebularine treatment affected the within-generation response to nutrient stress, pointing at a role of DNA methylation in phenotypic plasticity to nutrient environments. This study shows that stress exposure in apomictic dandelions can cause transgenerational phenotypic effects, in addition to previously demonstrated transgenerational DNA methylation effects."

 "AbstractText": "Functional traits, their plasticity and their integration in a phenotype have profound impacts on plant performance. We developed structural equation models (SEMs) to evaluate their relative contribution to promote invasiveness in plants along resource gradients. We compared 20 invasive-native phylogenetically and ecologically related pairs. SEMs included one morphological (root-to-shoot ratio (R/S)) and one physiological (photosynthesis nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE)) trait, their plasticities in response to nutrient and light variation, and phenotypic integration among 31 traits. Additionally, these components were related to two fitness estimators, biomass and survival. The relative contributions of traits, plasticity and integration were similar in invasive and native species. Trait means were more important than plasticity and integration for fitness. Invasive species showed higher fitness than natives because: they had lower R/S and higher PNUE values across gradients; their higher PNUE plasticity positively influenced biomass and thus survival; and they offset more the cases where plasticity and integration had a negative direct effect on fitness. Our results suggest that invasiveness is promoted by higher values in the fitness hierarchy--trait means are more important than trait plasticity, and plasticity is similar to integration--rather than by a specific combination of the three components of the functional strategy.",

 "AbstractText": "The role of phenotypical plasticity in ecological speciation and the evolution of sexual isolation remains largely unknown. We investigated whether or not divergent host plant use in an herbivorous insect causes assortative mating by phenotypically altering traits involved in mate recognition. We found that males of the mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae preferred to mate with females that were reared on the same plant species to females provided with a different plant species, based on divergent cuticular hydrocarbon profiles that serve as contact pheromones. The cuticular hydrocarbon phenotypes of the beetles were host plant specific and changed within 2 weeks after a shift to a novel host plant species. We suggest that plant-induced phenotypic divergence in mate recognition cues may act as an early barrier to gene flow between herbivorous insect populations on alternative host species, preceding genetic divergence and thus, promoting ecological speciation.",

 "AbstractText": "The ability of plant species to colonize new habitats and persist in changing environments depends on their ability to respond plastically to environmental variation and on the presence of genetic variation, thus allowing adaptation to new conditions. For invasive species in particular, the relationship between phenotypic trait expression, demography, and the quantitative genetic variation that is available to respond to selection are likely to be important determinants of the successful establishment and persistence of populations. However, the magnitude and sources of individual demographic variation in exotic plant populations remain poorly understood. How important is plasticity versus adaptability in populations of invasive species? Among environmental factors, is temperature, soil nutrients, or competition most influential, and at what scales and life stages do they affect the plants? To investigate these questions we planted seeds of the exotic annual plant Erodium brachycarpum into typical pasture habitat in a spatially nested design. Seeds were drawn from 30 inbred lines to enable quantification of genetic effects. Despite a positive population growth rate, a few plants (0.1 %) produced >50 % of the seeds, suggesting a low effective population size. Emergence and early growth varied by genotype, but as in previous studies on native plants, environmental effects greatly exceeded genetic effects, and survival was unrelated to genotype. Environmental influences shifted from microscale soil compaction and litter depth at emergence through to larger-scale soil nutrient gradients during growth and to competition during later survival and seed production. Temperature had no effect. Most demographic rates were positively correlated, but emergence was negatively correlated with other rates."

 "AbstractText": "Plant variety and cultivar identification is one of the most important aspects in agricultural systems. The large number of varieties or landraces among crop plants has made it difficult to identify and characterize varieties solely on the basis of morphological characters because they are non stable and originate due to environmental and climatic conditions, and therefore phenotypic plasticity is an outcome of adaptation. To mitigate this, scientists have developed and employed molecular markers, statistical tests and software to identify and characterize the required plant cultivars or varieties for cultivation, breeding programs as well as for cultivar-right-protection. The establishment of genome and transcriptome sequencing projects for many crops has led to generation of a huge wealth of sequence information that could find much use in identification of plants and their varieties. We review the current status of plant variety and cultivar identification, where an attempt has been made to describe the different strategies available for plant identification. We have found that despite the availability of methods and suitable markers for a wide range of crops, there is dearth of simple ways of making both morphological descriptors and molecular markers easy, referable and practical to use although there are ongoing attempts at making this possible. Certain limitations present a number of challenges for the development and utilization of modern scientific methods in variety or cultivar identification in many important crops."

 "AbstractText": "The developmental plasticity of organisms is a natural consequence of adaptation. Classical approaches targeting developmental processes usually focus on genetics as the essential factor underlying phenotypic differences. However, such differences are often based on the inherent plasticity of developmental programs. Due to their dependence on environmental stimuli, plants represent ideal experimental systems in which to dissect the contribution of genetic and environmental variation to phenotypic plasticity. An evident example is the vast repertoire of growth forms observed in plant shoot systems. A fundamental factor underlying the broadness of this repertoire is the activity of secondary meristems, namely the axillary meristems that give rise to side shoots, and the cambium essential for stem thickening. Differential activities of both meristem types are crucial to the tremendous variation seen in higher plant architecture. In this review, we discuss the role of secondary meristems in the adaptation of plant growth forms, and the ways in which they integrate environmental input. In particular, we explore potential approaches for dissecting the degree to which this flexibility and its consequences for plant architecture is genetically predetermined and how much it represents an adaptive value.",

 "AbstractText": "Climbing plants are a key component of rainforests, but mechanistic approaches to their distribution and abundance are scarce. In a southern temperate rainforest, we addressed whether the dominance of climbing plants across light environments is associated with the expression of ecophysiological traits. In mature forest and canopy gaps, we measured leaf size, specific leaf area, photosynthetic rate, and dark respiration in six of the most abundant woody vines. Mean values of traits and their phenotypic change (%) between mature forest and canopy gaps were predictor variables. Leaf size and specific leaf area were not significantly associated with climbing plant dominance. Variation in gas-exchange traits between mature forest and canopy gaps explained, at least partly, the dominance of climbers in this forest. A greater increase in photosynthetic rate and a lower increase in dark respiration rate when canopy openings occur were related to the success of climbing plant species. Dominant climbers showed a strategy of maximizing exploitation of resource availability but minimizing metabolic costs. Results may reflect phenotypic plasticity or genetic differentiation in ecophysiological traits between light environments. It is suggested that the dominant climbers in this temperate rainforest would be able to cope with forest clearings due to human activities."

The literature on phenotypic differences among populations is highly biased; for every one article published on a marine species, at least 10 articles are published on a terrestrial species and eight focus on terrestrial plants. Here, I outline what we know from the marine literature about geographic variation in phenotype in the sea, with a principal focus on local adaptation. The theory of environmental \"grain\" predicts that the most likely evolutionary response (e.g., local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, generalism, and balanced polymorphism) depends on the spatial scale of environmental variation relative to the distance that an organism disperses. Consistent with these predictions, phenotypic plasticity is stronger among invertebrates with geographically broad dispersal versus restricted dispersal (i.e., planktonic-dispersers versus direct-developers). However, contrary to predictions, the relative frequency, and spatial scale of local adaptation is not consistently greater among direct-developers relative to planktonic disperers. This indicates that the likelihood of local adaptation depends on other organismal or environmental traits. Two of the most vexing issues that remain include (1) predicting the extent to which barriers to dispersal are a cause versus consequence of phenotypic differentiation and (2) delineating the relative importance of evolutionary forces that favor or impede local adaptation. Understanding the mechanistic basis of the geography of phenotypic differences, or phenogeography, has gained recent momentum because of a need to predict impacts of global climatic change, anthropogenic disturbances, and dispersal of organisms to non-native habitats."

 "AbstractText": "• Plants respond to environmental change through alterations in organ size, number and biomass. However, different phenotypes are rarely integrated in a single model, and the prediction of plant responses to environmental conditions is challenging. The aim of this study was to simulate and predict plant phenotypic plasticity in development and growth using an organ-level functional-structural plant model, GreenLab. • Chrysanthemum plants were grown in climate chambers in 16 different environmental regimes: four different temperatures (15, 18, 21 and 24°C) combined with four different light intensities (40%, 51%, 65% and 100%, where 100% is 340 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹). Measurements included plant height, flower number and major organ dry mass (main and side-shoot stems, main and side-shoot leaves and flowers). To describe the basipetal flowering sequence, a position-dependent growth delay function was introduced into the model. • The model was calibrated on eight treatments. It was capable of simulating multiple plant phenotypes (flower number, organ biomass, plant height) with visual output. Furthermore, it predicted well the phenotypes of the other eight treatments (validation) through parameter interpolation. • This model could potentially serve to bridge models of different scales, and to link energy input to crop output in glasshouses.",

 "AbstractText": "Proper functioning of complex phenotypes requires that multiple traits work together. Examination of relationships among traits within and between complex characters and how they interact to function as a whole organism is critical to advancing our understanding of evolutionary developmental plasticity. Phenotypic integration refers to the relationships among multiple characters of a complex phenotype, and their relationships with other functional units (modules) in an organism. In this review, I summarize a brief history of the concept of phenotypic integration in plant and animal biology. Following an introduction of concepts, including modularity, I use an empirical case-study approach to highlight recent advance in clarifying the developmental and genomic basis of integration. I end by highlighting some novel approaches to genomic and epigenetic perturbations that offer promise in further addressing the role of phenotypic integration in evolutionary diversification. In the age of the phenotype, studies that examine the genomic and developmental changes in relationships of traits across environments will shape the next chapter in our quest for understanding the evolution of complex characters."

 "AbstractText": "1. Phenotypic plasticity, the response of individual phenotypes to their environment, can allow organisms to cope with spatio-temporal variation in environmental conditions. Recent studies have shown that variation exists among individuals in their capacity to adjust their traits to environmental changes and that this individual plasticity can be under strong selection. Yet, little is known on the extent and ultimate causes of variation between populations and individuals in plasticity patterns. 2. In passerines, timing of breeding is a key life-history trait strongly related to fitness and is known to vary with the environment, but few studies have investigated the within-species variation in individual plasticity. 3. Here, we studied between- and within-population variation in breeding time, phenotypic plasticity and selection patterns for this trait in four Mediterranean populations of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) breeding in habitats varying in structure and quality. 4. Although there was no significant warming over the course of the study, we found evidence for earlier onset of breeding in warmer years in all populations, with reduced plasticity in the less predictable environment. In two of four populations, there was significant inter-individual variation in plasticity for laying date. Interestingly, selection for earlier laying date was significant only in populations where there was no inter-individual differences in plasticity. 5. Our results show that generalization of plasticity patterns among populations of the same species might be challenging even at a small spatial scale and that the amount of within-individual variation in phenotypic plasticity may be linked to selective pressures acting on these phenotypic traits.",

 "AbstractText": "In herbaceous ecosystems worldwide, biodiversity has been negatively impacted by changed grazing regimes and nutrient enrichment. Altered disturbance regimes are thought to favour invasive species that have a high phenotypic plasticity, although most studies measure plasticity under controlled conditions in the greenhouse and then assume plasticity is an advantage in the field. Here, we compare trait plasticity between three co-occurring, C(4) perennial grass species, an invader Eragrostis curvula, and natives Eragrostis sororia and Aristida personata to grazing and fertilizer in a three-year field trial. We measured abundances and several leaf traits known to correlate with strategies used by plants to fix carbon and acquire resources, i.e. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nutrient concentrations (N, C:N, P), assimilation rates (Amax) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE). In the control treatment (grazed only), trait values for SLA, leaf C:N ratios, Amax and PNUE differed significantly between the three grass species. When trait values were compared across treatments, E. curvula showed higher trait plasticity than the native grasses, and this correlated with an increase in abundance across all but the grazed/fertilized treatment. The native grasses showed little trait plasticity in response to the treatments. Aristida personata decreased significantly in the treatments where E. curvula increased, and E. sororia abundance increased possibly due to increased rainfall and not in response to treatments or invader abundance. Overall, we found that plasticity did not favour an increase in abundance of E. curvula under the grazed/fertilized treatment likely because leaf nutrient contents increased and subsequently its' palatability to consumers. E. curvula also displayed a higher resource use efficiency than the native grasses. These findings suggest resource conditions and disturbance regimes can be manipulated to disadvantage the success of even plastic exotic species."

 "AbstractText": "Roots respond dynamically to belowground herbivore attack. Yet, little is known about the mechanisms and ecological consequences of these responses. Do roots behave the same way as leaves, or do the paradigms derived from aboveground research need to be rewritten? This is the central question that we tackle in this article. To this end, we review the current literature on induced root defenses and present a number of experiments on the interaction between the root herbivore Diabrotica virgifera and its natural host, maize. Currently, the literature provides no clear evidence that plants can recognize root herbivores specifically. In maize, mild mechanical damage is sufficient to trigger a root volatile response comparable to D. virgifera induction. Interestingly, the jasmonate (JA) burst, a highly conserved signaling event following leaf attack, is consistently attenuated in the roots across plant species, from wild tobacco to Arabidopsis. In accordance, we found only a weak JA response in D. virgifera attacked maize roots. Despite this reduction in JA-signaling, roots of many plants start producing a distinct suite of secondary metabolites upon attack and reconfigure their primary metabolism. We, therefore, postulate the existence of additional, unknown signals that govern induced root responses in the absence of a jasmonate burst. Surprisingly, despite the high phenotypic plasticity of plant roots, evidence for herbivore-induced resistance below ground is virtually absent from the literature. We propose that other defensive mechanisms, including resource reallocation and compensatory growth, may be more important to improve plant immunity below ground."

 "AbstractText": "Foliar anatomy and morphology are strongly related to physiological performance; therefore, phenotypic plasticity in leaves to variations in environmental conditions, such as irradiance and soil moisture availability, can be related to growth rate and survivorship, mainly during critical growth phases, such as establishment. The aim of this work was to analyze changes in the foliar internal anatomy (tissue proportions and cell dimensions) and external morphology (leaf length, width and area) of Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp. et Endl.) Krasser seedlings growing in a greenhouse under controlled irradiance (three levels) and soil moisture (two levels) during one growing season (measured three times), and to relate them to physiological traits. Three irradiance levels (4, 26 and 64% of the natural incident light) and two soil moisture levels (40 and 80% soil capacity) were evaluated during November, January and March. Internal foliar anatomy of seedlings was analyzed using digital photographs of histological cuttings, while leaf gross morphology was measured using digital calipers and image analysis software. Most internal anatomical variables presented significant differences under different irradiance levels during the growing season, but differences were not detected between soil moisture levels. Palisade parenchyma was the tissue most sensitive to irradiance levels, and high irradiance levels (64% natural incident light) produced greater values in most of the internal anatomical variables than lower irradiance levels (4-24% natural incident light). Complementarily, larger leaves were observed in medium and low irradiance levels, as well as under low soil moisture levels (40% soil capacity). The relationship of main results with some eco-physiological traits was discussed. Foliar internal anatomical and external morphological plasticity allows quick acclimation of seedlings to environmental changes (e.g., during harvesting). These results can be used to propose new forest practices that consider soil moisture and light availability changes to maintain high physiological performance of seedlings."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Copy number variation (CNV) might be one of the main contributors to phenotypic diversity and evolutionary adaptation in animals and plants, employing a wide variety of mechanisms, such as gene dosage and transcript structure alterations, to modulate organismal plasticity. In the past 4 years, considerable advances have been made in the characterization of the genomic architecture of CNV in domestic species. First, low-resolution CNV maps were produced for cattle, goat, sheep, pig, dog, chicken, duck and turkey, showing that these structural polymorphisms comprise a significant part of these genomes. Furthermore, CNVs have been associated with several pigmentation (white coat in horse, pig and sheep) and morphological (late feathering and pea comb in chicken) traits, as well as with susceptibility to a wide array of diseases and developmental disorders, for example osteopetrosis, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, copper toxicosis, intersexuality, cone degeneration, periodic fever and dermoid sinus, among others. In the future, development of high-resolution tools for CNV detection and typing combined with the implementation of databases integrating CNV, QTL and gene expression data will be essential to identify and measure the impact of this source of structural variation on the many phenotypes that are relevant to animal breeders and veterinary practitioners.",

 "AbstractText": "Multicellular eukaryotes demonstrate nongenetic, heritable phenotypic versatility in their adaptation to environmental changes. This inclusive inheritance is composed of interacting epigenetic, maternal, and environmental factors. Yet-unidentified maternal effects can have a pronounced influence on plant phenotypic adaptation to changing environmental conditions. To explore the control of phenotypy in higher plants, we examined the effect of a single plant nuclear gene on the expression and transmission of phenotypic variability in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). MutS HOMOLOG1 (MSH1) is a plant-specific nuclear gene product that functions in both mitochondria and plastids to maintain genome stability. RNA interference suppression of the gene elicits strikingly similar programmed changes in plant growth pattern in six different plant species, changes subsequently heritable independent of the RNA interference transgene. The altered phenotypes reflect multiple pathways that are known to participate in adaptation, including altered phytohormone effects for dwarfed growth and reduced internode elongation, enhanced branching, reduced stomatal density, altered leaf morphology, delayed flowering, and extended juvenility, with conversion to perennial growth pattern in short days. Some of these effects are partially reversed with the application of gibberellic acid. Genetic hemicomplementation experiments show that this phenotypic plasticity derives from changes in chloroplast state. Our results suggest that suppression of MSH1, which occurs under several forms of abiotic stress, triggers a plastidial response process that involves nongenetic inheritance."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is often postulated as a principal characteristic of tuber-bearing wild Solanum species. The hypotheses to explore this observation have been developed based on the presence of genetic variation. In this context, evolutionary changes and adaptation are impossible without genetic variation. However, epigenetic effects, which include DNA methylation and microRNAs expression control, could be another source of phenotypic variation in ecologically relevant traits. To achieve a detailed mechanistic understanding of these processes, it is necessary to separate epigenetic from DNA sequence-based effects and to evaluate their relative importance on phenotypic variability. We explored the potential relevance of epigenetic effects in individuals with the same genotype. For this purpose, a clone of the wild potato Solanum ruiz-lealii, a non-model species in which natural methylation variability has been demonstrated, was selected and its DNA methylation was manipulated applying 5-Azacytidine (AzaC), a demethylating agent. The AzaC treatment induced early flowering and changes in leaf morphology. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we identified four miRNAs up-regulated in the AzaC-treated plants. One of them, miRNA172, could play a role on the early flowering phenotype. In this work, we showed that the treatment with AzaC could provide meaningful results allowing to study both the phenotypic plasticity in tuber-bearing Solanum species and the inter-relation between DNA methylation and miRNA accumulations in a wide range of species."

 "AbstractText": "Correlations between developmentally plastic traits may constrain the joint evolution of traits. In plants, both seedling de-etiolation and shade avoidance elongation responses to crowding and foliage shade are mediated by partially overlapping developmental pathways, suggesting the possibility of pleiotropic constraints. To test for such constraints, we exposed inbred lines of Impatiens capensis to factorial combinations of leaf litter (which affects de-etiolation) and simulated foliage shade (which affects phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance). Increased elongation of hypocotyls caused by leaf litter phenotypically enhanced subsequent elongation of the first internode in response to low red:far red (R:FR). Trait expression was correlated across litter and shade conditions, suggesting that phenotypic effects of early plasticity on later plasticity may affect variation in elongation traits available to selection in different light environments."

 "AbstractText": "To investigate the regulation of seed metabolism and to estimate the degree of metabolic natural variability, metabolite profiling and network analysis were applied to a collection of 76 different homozygous tomato introgression lines (ILs) grown in the field in two consecutive harvest seasons. Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL). Amino acid contents displayed a high degree of variability across the population, with similar patterns across the two seasons, while sugars exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Upon integration of data for tomato pericarp metabolite profiling, factorial ANOVA identified the main factor for metabolic polymorphism to be the genotypic background rather than the environment or the tissue. Analysis of the coefficient of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in the ILs than in the M82 tomato cultivar. Broad-sense estimate of heritability suggested that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in the seed differed from that in the fruit. Correlation-based metabolic network analysis comparing metabolite data for the seed with that for the pericarp showed that the seed network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than the fruit. Amino acids in the seed metabolic network were shown to play a central hub-like role in the topology of the network, maintaining high interactions with other metabolite categories, i.e., sugars and organic acids. Network analysis identified six exceptionally highly co-regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro. The strong interdependence of this group was confirmed by the mQTL mapping. Taken together these results (i) reflect the extensive redundancy of the regulation underlying seed metabolism, (ii) demonstrate the tight co-ordination of seed metabolism with respect to fruit metabolism, and (iii) emphasize the centrality of the amino acid module in the seed metabolic network. Finally, the study highlights the added value of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping."

 "text": "The genetic control of important adaptive traits, such as bud set, is still poorly understood in most forest trees species. Poplar is an ideal model tree to study bud set because of its indeterminate shoot growth. Thus, a full-sib family derived from an intraspecific cross of P. nigra with 162 clonally replicated progeny was used to assess the phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation of bud set in two sites of contrasting environmental conditions.",

 "text": "Six crucial phenological stages of bud set were scored. Night length appeared to be the most important signal triggering the onset of growth cessation. Nevertheless, the effect of other environmental factors, such as temperature, increased during the process. Moreover, a considerable role of genotype × environment (G × E) interaction was found in all phenological stages with the lowest temperature appearing to influence the sensitivity of the most plastic genotypes.Descriptors of growth cessation and bud onset explained the largest part of phenotypic variation of the entire process. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these traits were detected. For the four selected traits (the onset of growth cessation (date2.5), the transition from shoot to bud (date1.5), the duration of bud formation (subproc1) and bud maturation (subproc2)) eight and sixteen QTL were mapped on the maternal and paternal map, respectively. The identified QTL, each one characterized by small or modest effect, highlighted the complex nature of traits involved in bud set process. Comparison between map location of QTL and P. trichocarpa genome sequence allowed the identification of 13 gene models, 67 bud set-related expressional and six functional candidate genes (CGs). These CGs are functionally related to relevant biological processes, environmental sensing, signaling, and cell growth and development. Some strong QTL had no obvious CGs, and hold great promise to identify unknown genes that affect bud set.",

 "AbstractText": "Populations can respond to environmental heterogeneity by genetic adaptation to local conditions. Evidence for local adaptation in herbivores with relatively broad host breadth is scarce, either because generalists rarely locally adapt or because fewer studies have tested for local adaptation. The marine isopod Idotea balthica, a small (<3 cm) generalist herbivore common to estuaries of the northwestern Atlantic, is found on multiple macroalgae and sea grasses north of 42°N, while more southerly populations utilize sea grass-dominated and macroalgal-poor habitats. Feeding preference assays revealed a latitudinal shift in preference hierarchy that mirrors this geographic variation in host availability. Northern populations have higher feeding preference for fresh and freeze-dried tissue of the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus and consumed more of its water-soluble and lipophilic extracts relative to southern populations. In contrast, southern populations have a relatively higher preference for the green macroalga Ulva linza and sea grass Zostera marina. The rank of hosts in feeding assays exhibited by northern adults (Fucus = Ulva > Zostera) and southern adults (Ulva > Fucus > Zostera) closely mirrored ranking of juvenile growth rates, suggesting that preference and performance are strongly correlated across these macrophytes. Several of our assays included isopods that had parents reared under uniform laboratory conditions, indicating that geographic differences are genetically mediated and unlikely to reflect phenotypic plasticity or maternal effects. Local adaptation in host use traits may be common in broadly distributed, generalist herbivores in marine and terrestrial systems, and will manifest itself as local shifts in the preference ranking of hosts."

 "AbstractText": "Environmental cues influence the development of stomata on the leaf epidermis, and allow plants to exert plasticity in leaf stomatal abundance in response to the prevailing growing conditions. It is reported that Arabidopsis thaliana 'Landsberg erecta' plants grown under low relative humidity have a reduced stomatal index and that two genes in the stomatal development pathway, SPEECHLESS and FAMA, become de novo cytosine methylated and transcriptionally repressed. These environmentally-induced epigenetic responses were abolished in mutants lacking the capacity for de novo DNA methylation, for the maintenance of CG methylation, and in mutants for the production of short-interfering non-coding RNAs (siRNAs) in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Induction of methylation was quantitatively related to the induction of local siRNAs under low relative humidity. Our results indicate the involvement of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene suppression at these loci in response to environmental stress. Thus, in a physiologically important pathway, a targeted epigenetic response to a specific environmental stress is reported and several of its molecular, mechanistic components are described, providing a tractable platform for future epigenetics experiments. Our findings suggest epigenetic regulation of stomatal development that allows for anatomical and phenotypic plasticity, and may help to explain at least some of the plant's resilience to fluctuating relative humidity."

 "AbstractText": "A non-native plant species spreading along an environmental gradient may need to adjust its growth to the prevailing conditions that it encounters by a combination of phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. There have been several studies of how non-native species respond to changing environmental conditions along latitudinal gradients, but much less is known about elevational gradients. We conducted a climate chamber experiment to investigate plastic and genetically based growth responses of 13 herbaceous non-native plants along an elevational gradient from 100 to 2,000 m a.s.l. in Tenerife. Conditions in the field ranged from high anthropogenic disturbance but generally favourable temperatures for plant growth in the lower half of the gradient, to low disturbance but much cooler conditions in the upper half. We collected seed from low, mid and high elevations and grew them in climate chambers under the characteristic temperatures at these three elevations. Growth of all species was reduced under lower temperatures along both halves of the gradient. We found consistent genetically based differences in growth over the upper elevational gradient, with plants from high-elevation sites growing more slowly than those from mid-elevation ones, while the pattern in the lower part of the gradient was more mixed. Our data suggest that many non-native plants might respond to climate along elevational gradients by genetically based changes in key traits, especially at higher elevations where low temperatures probably impose a stronger selection pressure. At lower elevations, where anthropogenic influences are greater, higher gene flow and frequent disturbance might favour genotypes with broad ecological amplitudes. Thus the importance of evolutionary processes for invasion success is likely to be context-dependent."

 "AbstractText": "Epigenetic modifications are ancient and widely utilised mechanisms that have been recruited across fungi, plants and animals for diverse but fundamental biological functions, such as cell differentiation. Recently, a functional DNA methylation system was identified in the honeybee, where it appears to underlie queen and worker caste differentiation. This discovery, along with other insights into the epigenetics of social insects, allows provocative analogies to be drawn between insect caste differentiation and cellular differentiation, particularly in mammals. Developing larvae in social insect colonies are totipotent: they retain the ability to specialise as queens or workers, in a similar way to the totipotent cells of early embryos before they differentiate into specific cell lineages. Further, both differentiating cells and insect castes lose phenotypic plasticity by committing to their lineage, losing the ability to be readily reprogrammed. Hence, a comparison of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying lineage differentiation (and reprogramming) between cells and social insects is worthwhile. Here we develop a conceptual model of how loss and regain of phenotypic plasticity might be conserved for individual specialisation in both cells and societies. This framework forges a novel link between two fields of biological research, providing predictions for a unified approach to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying biological complexity.",

A growing body of evidence demonstrates that plants are able to adapt to imminent threats by perceiving cues emitted from their damaged neighbours.

Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes the most frequent opportunistic fungal infection in immunocompromised hosts, has three serotypes: A, D, and AD. Serotype-specific multilocus sequence typing and serotype-specific comparative genome hybridization were applied to investigate the genetic variability and genomic organization of C. neoformans serotype AD isolates. We confirm that C. neoformans serotype AD isolates are hybrids of serotype A and D strains. Compared with haploid strains, most AD hybrid isolates exhibit unique multilocus sequence typing genotypes, suggesting that multiple independent hybridization events punctuated the origin and evolutionary trajectory of AD hybrids. The MATa alleles from both haploid and AD hybrid isolates group closely to form a cluster or subcluster in both the serotype A and D populations. The rare and unique distribution of MATa alleles may restrict sexual reproduction between isolates of opposite mating types. The genetic diversity of the serotype D population, including haploid strains and serotype D genomes of the AD hybrid, is significantly greater than that of serotype A, and there are signatures of recombination within the serotype D population. Given that MATa isolates are relatively rare, both opposite-sex and same-sex mating may contribute to genetic recombination of serotype D in nature. Extensive chromosome loss was observed in AD hybrid isolates, which results in loss of heterozygosity in the otherwise-heterozygous AD hybrid genome. Most AD hybrid isolates exhibit hybrid vigor and are resistant to the antifungal drug FK506. In addition, the C. neoformans AD hybrid genome is highly dynamic, with continuous chromosome loss, which may be a facile route for pathogen evolution through which genotypic and phenotypic variation is generated."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity has long been suspected to allow invasive species to expand their geographic range across large-scale environmental gradients. We tested this possibility in Australia using a continental scale survey of the invasive tree Parkinsonia aculeata (Fabaceae) in twenty-three sites distributed across four climate regions and three habitat types. Using tree-level responses, we detected a trade-off between seed mass and seed number across the moisture gradient. Individual trees plastically and reversibly produced many small seeds at dry sites or years, and few big seeds at wet sites and years. Bigger seeds were positively correlated with higher seed and seedling survival rates. The trade-off, the relation between seed mass, seed and seedling survival, and other fitness components of the plant life-cycle were integrated within a matrix population model. The model confirms that the plastic response resulted in average fitness benefits across the life-cycle. Plasticity resulted in average fitness being positively maintained at the wet and dry range margins where extinction risks would otherwise have been high (\"Jack-of-all-Trades\" strategy JT), and fitness being maximized at the species range centre where extinction risks were already low (\"Master-of-Some\" strategy MS). The resulting hybrid \"Jack-and-Master\" strategy (JM) broadened the geographic range and amplified average fitness in the range centre. Our study provides the first empirical evidence for a JM species. It also confirms mechanistically the importance of phenotypic plasticity in determining the size, the shape and the dynamic of a species distribution. The JM allows rapid and reversible phenotypic responses to new or changing moisture conditions at different scales, providing the species with definite advantages over genetic adaptation when invading diverse and variable environments. Furthermore, natural selection pressure acting on phenotypic plasticity is predicted to result in maintenance of the JT and strengthening of the MS, further enhancing the species invasiveness in its range centre."

 "AbstractText": "Plant species introduced into novel ranges may become invasive due to evolutionary change, phenotypic plasticity, or other biotic or abiotic mechanisms. Evolution of introduced populations could be the result of founder effects, drift, hybridization, or adaptation to local conditions, which could enhance the invasiveness of introduced species. However, understanding whether the success of invading populations is due to genetic differences between native and introduced populations may be obscured by origin x environment interactions. That is, studies conducted under a limited set of environmental conditions may show inconsistent results if native or introduced populations are differentially adapted to specific conditions. We tested for genetic differences between native and introduced populations, and for origin x environment interactions, between native (China) and introduced (U.S.) populations of the invasive annual grass Microstegium vimineum (stiltgrass) across 22 common gardens spanning a wide range of habitats and environmental conditions. On average, introduced populations produced 46% greater biomass and had 7.4% greater survival, and outperformed native range populations in every common garden. However, we found no evidence that introduced Microstegium exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity than native populations. Biomass of Microstegium was positively correlated with light and resident community richness and biomass across the common gardens. However, these relationships were equivalent for native and introduced populations, suggesting that the greater mean performance of introduced populations is not due to unequal responses to specific environmental parameters. Our data on performance of invasive and native populations suggest that post-introduction evolutionary changes may have enhanced the invasive potential of this species. Further, the ability of Microstegium to survive and grow across the wide variety of environmental conditions demonstrates that few habitats are immune to invasion."

 "AbstractText": "Plants may experience different environmental cues throughout their development which interact in determining their phenotype. This paper tests the hypothesis that environmental conditions experienced early during ontogeny affect the phenotypic response to subsequent environmental cues. This hypothesis was tested by exposing different accessions of Rumex palustris to different light and nutrient conditions, followed by subsequent complete submergence. Final leaf length and submergence-induced plasticity were affected by the environmental conditions experienced at early developmental stages. In developmentally older leaves, submergence-induced elongation was lower in plants previously subjected to high-light conditions. Submergence-induced elongation of developmentally younger leaves, however, was larger when pregrown in high light. High-light and low-nutrient conditions led to an increase of nonstructural carbohydrates in the plants. There was a positive correlation between submergence-induced leaf elongation and carbohydrate concentration and content in roots and shoots, but not with root and shoot biomass before submergence. These results show that conditions experienced by young plants modulate the responses to subsequent environmental conditions, in both magnitude and direction. Internal resource status interacts with cues perceived at different developmental stages in determining plastic responses to the environment.",

 "AbstractText": "The maximum size and age that clonal organisms can reach remains poorly known, although we do know that the largest natural clones can extend over hundreds or thousands of metres and potentially live for centuries. We made a review of findings to date, which reveal that the maximum clone age and size estimates reported in the literature are typically limited by the scale of sampling, and may grossly underestimate the maximum age and size of clonal organisms. A case study presented here shows the occurrence of clones of slow-growing marine angiosperm Posidonia oceanica at spatial scales ranging from metres to hundreds of kilometres, using microsatellites on 1544 sampling units from a total of 40 locations across the Mediterranean Sea. This analysis revealed the presence, with a prevalence of 3.5 to 8.9%, of very large clones spreading over one to several (up to 15) kilometres at the different locations. Using estimates from field studies and models of the clonal growth of P. oceanica, we estimated these large clones to be hundreds to thousands of years old, suggesting the evolution of general purpose genotypes with large phenotypic plasticity in this species. These results, obtained combining genetics, demography and model-based calculations, question present knowledge and understanding of the spreading capacity and life span of plant clones. These findings call for further research on these life history traits associated with clonality, considering their possible ecological and evolutionary implications."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity of two primitive wheat species (Triticum monococcum L. and Triticum dicoccum S.) was studied in response to early chilling stress. Selection pressure differentials, gradients and plasticity costs on plant morphogenesis, growth and reserve carbohydrate consumption were estimated. Regression analysis was applied to investigate differential developmental changes and patterns between treatments. Four-day-old seedlings of T. monococcum and T. dicoccum, differing in plant stature and reserve carbohydrates, were given an early chilling temperature (4 °C for 42 day) and compared with control plants grown at 23 °C. Early chilling stress resulted in a significant increase in leaf mass ratio (LMR) and relative growth rate (RGR), a reduction in flag leaf size, total biomass, specific leaf area (SLA) and reserve carbohydrate storage at flowering, together with advanced onset of flowering. Selection pressure within the early chilling environment favoured early flowering, smaller SLA, higher LMR and lower reserve carbohydrates, suggesting the observed responses were adaptive. Furthermore, a regression of daily cumulative plant biomass derived from a crop growth simulation model (CERES-Wheat) on crop vegetation period revealed a divergent developmental pattern in early-chilled plants. Using selection pressure gradient analysis, we found similar responses among these traits, except for SLA and sucrose, indicating that these two traits have indirect effects on fitness. Thus, the total effects of SLA and reserve sucrose on relative fitness seem to be buffered via the rapid growth rate in chilled plants. While lower SLA may reduce early chilling stress effects at an individual leaf level, a higher LMR and use of reserve carbohydrates indicated that compensatory growth of chilled plants during the recovery period relied on the concerted action of altered resource allocation and reserve carbohydrate consumption. However, a significant cost of plasticity was evident only for flowering time, LMR and fructan levels in the early chilling environment. Our results demonstrate that morphological and intrinsic developmental (ontogenetic) patterns in two Triticum species respond to early chilling stress.",

 "AbstractText": "Cardenolides are remarkable steroidal toxins that have become model systems, critical in the development of theories for chemical ecology and coevolution. Because cardenolides inhibit the ubiquitous and essential animal enzyme Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, most insects that feed on cardenolide-containing plants are highly specialized. With a huge diversity of chemical forms, these secondary metabolites are sporadically distributed across 12 botanical families, but dominate the Apocynaceae where they are found in > 30 genera. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated patterns in the distribution of cardenolides among plant organs, including all tissue types, and across broad geographic gradients within and across species. Cardenolide production has a genetic basis and is subject to natural selection by herbivores. In addition, there is strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity, with the biotic and abiotic environment predictably impacting cardenolide production. Mounting evidence indicates a high degree of specificity in herbivore-induced cardenolides in Asclepias. While herbivores of cardenolide-containing plants often sequester the toxins, are aposematic, and possess several physiological adaptations (including target site insensitivity), there is strong evidence that these specialists are nonetheless negatively impacted by cardenolides. While reviewing both the mechanisms and evolutionary ecology of cardenolide-mediated interactions, we advance novel hypotheses and suggest directions for future work.",

 "AbstractText": "Knowledge about the root system structure and the uptake efficiency of root orders is critical to understand the adaptive plasticity of plants towards salt stress. Thus, this study describes the phenological and physiological plasticity of Citrus volkameriana rootstocks under severe NaCl stress on the level of root orders. Phenotypic root traits known to influence uptake processes, for example frequency of root orders, specific root area, cortical thickness, and xylem traits, did not change homogeneously throughout the root system, but changes after 6 months under 90 mM NaCl stress were root order specific. Chloride accumulation significantly increased with decreasing root order, and the Cl(-) concentration in lower root orders exceeded those in leaves. Water flux densities of first-order roots decreased to <20% under salinity and did not recover after stress release. The water flux densities of higher root orders changed marginally under salinity and increased 2- to 6-fold in second and third root orders after short-term stress release. Changes in root order frequency, morphology, and anatomy indicate rapid and major modification of C. volkameriana root systems under salt stress. Reduced water uptake under salinity was related to changes of water flux densities among root orders and to reduced root surface areas. The importance of root orders for water uptake changed under salinity from root tips towards higher root orders. The root order-specific changes reflect differences in vulnerability (indicated by the salt accumulation) and ontogenetic status, and point to functional differences among root orders under high salinity."

 "AbstractText": "The laminae of leaves optimize photosynthetic rates by serving as a platform for both light capture and gas exchange, while minimizing water losses associated with thermoregulation and transpiration. Many have speculated that plants maximize photosynthetic output and minimize associated costs through leaf size, complexity, and shape, but a unifying theory linking the plethora of observed leaf forms with the environment remains elusive. Additionally, the leaf itself is a plastic structure, responsive to its surroundings, further complicating the relationship. Despite extensive knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying angiosperm leaf development, little is known about how phenotypic plasticity and selective pressures converge to create the diversity of leaf shapes and sizes across lineages. Here, we use wild tomato accessions, collected from locales with diverse levels of foliar shade, temperature, and precipitation, as a model to assay the extent of shade avoidance in leaf traits and the degree to which these leaf traits correlate with environmental factors. We find that leaf size is correlated with measures of foliar shade across the wild tomato species sampled and that leaf size and serration correlate in a species-dependent fashion with temperature and precipitation. We use far-red induced changes in leaf length as a proxy measure of the shade avoidance response, and find that shade avoidance in leaves negatively correlates with the level of foliar shade recorded at the point of origin of an accession. The direction and magnitude of these correlations varies across the leaf series, suggesting that heterochronic and/or ontogenic programs are a mechanism by which selective pressures can alter leaf size and form. This study highlights the value of wild tomato accessions for studies of both morphological and light-regulated development of compound leaves, and promises to be useful in the future identification of genes regulating potentially adaptive plastic leaf traits."

 "text": "Since the early 1990s, research on genetic variation of phenotypic plasticity has expanded and empirical research has emphasized the role of the environment on the expression of inbreeding depression. An emerging question is how these two evolutionary ecology mechanisms interact in novel environments. Interest in this area has grown with the need to understand the establishment of populations in response to climate change, and to human-assisted transport to novel environments.",

The experiment was planted in California in each population's home site, in the other populations's home site, in a novel site within the native range of M. guttatus, and in a novel site within the non-native range in North America. The experiment included nearly 6500 individuals. Survival, sexual reproduction and above-ground biomass were examined in order to evaluate inbreeding depression, and stem diameter and plant height were examined in order to evaluate phenotypic plasticity.",

Both isoforms of early-light-induced protein (ELIP) were absent in the indoor plants, and they had less non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The field-grown plants had a high capacity to perform state transitions. Plants lacking ELIPs did not have reduced growth or seed set rates, but their mortality rates were sometimes higher. NPQ levels between natural accessions grown under different conditions were not correlated.",

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity has been defined as the ability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes when exposed to distinct environments throughout its ontogeny. Morphological variability of individuals is an example of this plasticity. Taking into account that several studies have reported a wide morphological variability in Varroa destructor populations, we evaluated if the body size plasticity of the parasite constituted a key factor able to modulate mites survival when they were exposed to a drug bioassays. Drug bioassays against mites were conducted using three different Syzygium aromaticum essential oil concentrations (0.5, 1, and 5 μl/capsule) and controls. After 4 h of exposition, mite mortality was registered. The width (WS) and length (LS) of the dorsal shield were measured in dead mites. General lineal models were carried to determine if V. destructor survival to acaricides was related to the explanatory variables. Data modelling confirmed that WS and LS variables, together with time interaction, were significantly related to V. destructor survival when the parasites were exposed to acaricides. The models proposed demonstrated that for the smaller S. aromaticum essential oil concentration, the larger the parasite body, the greater the probability that it remains alive at the end of the bioassay. Such relationship was inverse for the other two concentrations tested. Possible causes explaining the body size variability in V. destructor individuals were discussed."

 "AbstractText": "In addition to genetic differences between individuals as a result of nucleotide sequence variation, epigenetic changes that occur as a result of DNA methylation may also contribute to population niche width by enhancing phenotypic plasticity, although this intriguing possibility remains essentially untested. Using the nectar-living yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii as study subject, we examine the hypothesis that changes in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns underlie the ability of this fugitive species to exploit a broad resource range in its heterogeneous and patchy environment. Data on floral nectar characteristics and their use by M. reukaufii in the wild were combined with laboratory experiments and methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analyses designed to detect epigenetic responses of single genotypes to variations in sugar environment that mimicked those occurring naturally in nectar. M. reukaufii exploited a broad range of resources, occurring in nectar of 48% of species and 52% of families surveyed, and its host plants exhibited broad intra- and interspecific variation in sugar-related nectar features. Under experimental conditions, sugar composition, sugar concentration and their interaction significantly influenced the mean probability of MSAP markers experiencing a transition from unmethylated to methylated state. Alterations in methylation status were not random but predictably associated with certain markers. The methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC) had strong inhibitory effects on M. reukaufii proliferation in sugar-containing media, and a direct relationship existed across sugar × concentration experimental levels linking inhibitory effect of 5-AzaC and mean per-marker probability of genome-wide methylation. Environmentally induced DNA methylation polymorphisms allowed genotypes to grow successfully in extreme sugar environments, and the broad population niche width of M. reukaufii was largely made possible by epigenetic changes enabling genotype plasticity in resource use.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Plant models offer a method to examine the efficacy of homeopathic solutions. Homeopathic Phosphorus (P) dynamizations were evaluated on the linear growth and dry biomass of Verbena gratissima, a plant native to Brazil. The yields and chemical characterization of the essential oil are also given. Plants exhibited phenotypic plasticity after the homeopathic Phosphorus treatments. The dynamization 9CH, in particular, interfered with plant growth, height, diameter of stems and total dry mass. 9CH treatment showed the highest yield of essential oil. The essential oil composition of V. gratissima varied according to the different dynamization used. Homeopathic Phosphorus provided the greatest amount of beta-pinene, trans-pinocarveol, trans-pinocamphone and trans-pinocarvyl acetate in comparison with controls."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Myrcianthes ferreyrae is an endemic, endangered species, with a small number of individuals located only in hyperarid, fog-oases known as lomas along the Peruvian desert in southern Peru, where fog is the main source of water. Following centuries of severe deforestation, reforestation with this native species was conducted in the Atiquipa lomas, Arequipa-Perú. On five slopes, five 2-year-old seedlings were irrigated monthly with water trapped by raschel-mesh fog collectors, supplementing natural rainfall with 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm month(-1) from February to August 2008. We measured plant growth, increment in basal diameter, height and five leaf traits: leaf mass area (LMA), leaf carbon isotope composition (δ(13)C), nitrogen per leaf area, total leaf carbon and stomatal density; which are indicative of the physiological changes resulting from increased water supply. Plant growth rates, estimated from the variation of either shoot basal diameter or maximum height, were highly correlated with total biomass. Only LMA and δ(13)C were higher in irrigated than in control plants, but we found no further differences among irrigation treatments. This threshold response suggests an on-off strategy fitted to exploit pulses of fog water, which are always limited in magnitude in comparison with natural rain. The absence of a differential response to increased water supply is in agreement with the low phenotypic plasticity expected in plants from very stressful environments. Our results have practical implications for reforestation projects, since irrigating with 20 mm per month is sufficient to achieve the full growth capacity of this species."

 "AbstractText": "Organisms can adjust their phenotype in response to changing environmental conditions. This phenomenon is termed phenotypic plasticity. Despite its ubiquitous occurrence, there has been very little study on the molecular mechanism of phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, rice plasticity 1 (rpl1), that displayed increased environment-dependent phenotypic variations. RPL1 was expressed in all tissues examined. The protein was localized in the nucleus and its distribution in the nucleus overlapped with heterochromatin. The rpl1 mutation led to an increase in DNA methylation on repetitive sequences and a decrease in overall histone acetylation. In addition, the mutation affected responses of the rice plant to phytohormones such as brassinosteroid, gibberellin, and cytokinin. Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene. These data suggest that RPL1 regulated phenotypic plasticity likely through its involvement in epigenetic processes affecting responses of the plant to phytohormones."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is common in many taxa, and it may increase an organism's fitness in heterogeneous environments. However, in some cases, the frequency of environmental changes can be faster than the ability of the individual to produce new adaptive phenotypes. The importance of such a time delay in terms of individual fitness and species adaptability has not been well studied. Here, we studied gender plasticity of Alternanthera philoxeroides to address this issue through a reciprocal transplant experiment. We observed that the genders of A. philoxeroides were plastic and reversible between monoclinous and pistillody depending on habitats, the offspring maintained the maternal genders in the first year but changed from year 2 to 5, and there was a cubic relationship between the rate of population gender changes and environmental variations. This relationship indicates that the species must overcome a threshold of environmental variations to switch its developmental path ways between the two genders. This threshold and the maternal gender stability cause a significant delay of gender changes in new environments. At the same time, they result in and maintain the two distinct habitat dependent gender phenotypes. We also observed that there was a significant and adaptive life-history differentiation between monoclinous and pistillody individuals and the gender phenotypes were developmentally linked with the life-history traits. Therefore, the gender phenotypes are adaptive. Low seed production, seed germination failure and matching phenotypes to habitats by gender plasticity indicate that the adaptive phenotypic diversity in A. philoxeroides may not be the result of ecological selection, but of gender plasticity. The delay of the adaptive gender phenotype realization in changing environments can maintain the differentiation between gender systems and their associated life-history traits, which may be an important component in evolution of novel traits and taxonomic diversity."

 "text": "To identify the determinants of invasiveness, comparisons of traits of invasive and native species are commonly performed. Invasiveness is generally linked to higher values of reproductive, physiological and growth-related traits of the invasives relative to the natives in the introduced range. Phenotypic plasticity of these traits has also been cited to increase the success of invasive species but has been little studied in invasive tree species. In a greenhouse experiment, we compared ecophysiological traits between an invasive species to Europe, Acer negundo, and early- and late-successional co-occurring native species, under different light, nutrient availability and disturbance regimes. We also compared species of the same species groups in situ, in riparian forests.",

 "text": "Under non-limiting resources, A. negundo seedlings showed higher growth rates than the native species. However, A. negundo displayed equivalent or lower photosynthetic capacities and nitrogen content per unit leaf area compared to the native species; these findings were observed both on the seedlings in the greenhouse experiment and on adult trees in situ. These physiological traits were mostly conservative along the different light, nutrient and disturbance environments. Overall, under non-limiting light and nutrient conditions, specific leaf area and total leaf area of A. negundo were substantially larger. The invasive species presented a higher plasticity in allocation to foliage and therefore in growth with increasing nutrient and light availability relative to the native species.",

 "text": "The higher level of plasticity of the invasive species in foliage allocation in response to light and nutrient availability induced a better growth in non-limiting resource environments. These results give us more elements on the invasiveness of A. negundo and suggest that such behaviour could explain the ability of A. negundo to outperform native tree species, contributes to its spread in European resource-rich riparian forests and impedes its establishment under closed-canopy hardwood forests.",

 "AbstractText": "Increased summer drought will exacerbate the regeneration of many tree species at their lower latitudinal and altitudinal distribution limits. In vulnerable habitats, introduction of more drought-tolerant provenances or species is currently considered to accelerate tree species migration and facilitate forest persistence. Trade-offs between drought adaptation and growth plasticity might, however, limit the effectiveness of assisted migration, especially if introductions focus on provenances or species from different climatic regions. We tested in a common garden experiment the performance of Pinus sylvestris seedlings from the continental Central Alps under increased temperatures and extended spring and/or summer drought, and compared seedling emergence, survival and biomass allocation to that of P. sylvestris and closely related Pinus nigra from a Mediterranean seed source. Soil heating had only minor effects on seedling performance but high spring precipitation doubled the number of continental P. sylvestris seedlings present after the summer drought. At the same time, twice as many seedlings of the Mediterranean than the continental P. sylvestris provenance were present, which was due to both higher emergence and lower mortality under dry conditions. Both P. sylvestris provenances allocated similar amounts of biomass to roots when grown under low summer precipitation. Mediterranean seedlings, however, revealed lower phenotypic plasticity than continental seedlings under high precipitation, which might limit their competitive ability in continental Alpine forests in non-drought years. By contrast, high variability in the response of individual seedlings to summer drought indicates the potential of continental P. sylvestris provenances to adapt to changing environmental conditions."

 "text": "Pyrosequencing of RNA extracted from shoot apices provided extensive transcriptome coverage - a catalog of 129,993 unigenes (49,748 contigs and 80,245 singletons) was generated from 398 million base pairs, or 1.14 million reads. The pyrosequencing data enriched considerably existing Eucalyptus EST collections, adding 36,985 unigenes not previously represented. Digital analysis of read abundance in 14,460 contigs identified 1,280 that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes, 155 contigs showing differential expression between treatments (irrigated vs. non irrigated conditions during the dry season), and 274 contigs with significant genotype-by-treatment interaction. The more productive genotype displayed a larger set of genes responding to water stress. Moreover, stress signal transduction seemed to involve different pathways in the two genotypes, suggesting that water shortage induces distinct cellular stress cascades. Similarly, the response of functional proteins also varied widely between genotypes: the most productive genotype decreased expression of genes related to photosystem, transport and secondary metabolism, whereas genes related to primary metabolism and cell organisation were over-expressed.",

Its strategy may involve a decrease of photosynthetic activity during the dry season associated with resources reallocation through major changes in the expression of primary metabolism associated genes. Further efforts will be needed to assess the adaptive nature of the genes highlighted in this study.",

 "AbstractText": "Allopolyploidy is considered as a major factor contributing to speciation, diversification, and plant ecological adaptation. In particular, the expression of duplicate genes (homeologs) can be altered leading to functional plasticity and to phenotypic novelty. This study investigated the influence of growing temperatures on homeologous gene expression in Coffea arabica L., a recent allopolyploid involving 2 closely related diploid parental species. The relative expression of homeologs of 13 genes all located in the same genomic region was analyzed using an SNP ratio quantification method based on dideoxy-terminated sequences of cDNA amplicons. The relative expression of homeologous genes varied depending on the gene, the organ, and the growing condition. Nevertheless, expression of both homeologs was always detected (i.e., no silencing). Although the growing conditions were suitable for one or other of the parental species, neither subgenome appeared preferentially expressed. Furthermore, relative homeologous expression showed moderate variations across organs and conditions and appeared uncorrelated between adjacent genes. These results indicate the absence of signs of subfunctionalization suggesting C. arabica has not undergone noticeable diploidization. Furthermore, these results suggest that the expression of homeologous genes in C. arabica is regulated by a shared trans-regulation mechanism acting similarly on the 2 subgenomes and that the observed biases in the relative homeolog expression may result from cis fine-scale factors."

 "text": "The main selection pressure in this desert environment, perhaps unsurprisingly, is water. Increased water availability resulted in greater growth in the southern population, which normally receives far less rain than the northern population. Even under the conditions that we defined as low water and/or nutrients, the performance of the seedlings from the southern population was significantly better, perhaps reflecting selection for these traits. Consistent with previous studies of this genus, there was no evidence of trade-offs between physical and chemical defences and plant growth parameters in this study. Rather, there appeared to be positive correlations between plant size and defence parameters. The great variation in several traits in both populations may result in a diverse potential for responding to selection pressures in different environments.",

Differential gene expression analyses in response to osmotic stress and ABA revealed a strong interplay among various metabolic pathways including abscisic acid and 13-lipoxygenase, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and plant defense pathways. Transcription factor analysis indicated that groups of genes may be co-regulated by similar regulatory sequences to which the expressed transcription factors bind. We successfully exploited the data presented here in conjunction with published transcriptome analyses for rice, maize, and Arabidopsis to discover more than 50 differentially expressed, drought-responsive gene orthologs for which no function had been previously ascribed.",

 "AbstractText": "This paper studied the effects of different shading (light transmittance 20%, 40%, 60%, and 100%) on the photosynthesis characteristics of two ornamental foliage plants Photinia x frasery and Aucuba japonica var. variegata. After shading for six weeks, the net photosynthesis rates of two plants measured ex situ under natural light enhanced, compared to those measured in situ, and, with the increase of shading degree, the net photosynthetic rates had an increasing trend, with the maximum being 9.7 micromol x m(-2) x s(-1) for Photinia x frasery and 8.3 micromol x m(-2) x s(-1) for Aucuba japonica var. variegata. In the meantime, the transpiration rates of the two plants increased significantly. Shading increased the chlorophyll a, b, and a+b contents and the chlorophyll/carotenoids ratio, decreased the chlorophyll a/b, but less affected the carotenoids content. The phenotypic plasticity index (PPI) of net photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate of Photinia x frasery and Aucuba japonica var. variegate was 2.08 and 3.21, and 0.55 and 1.60, respectively. The chlorophyll and carotenoids contents of the two plants were relatively stable, indicating the minor influence of external environment factors on pigments. Aucuba japonica var. variegata had a higher shading tolerance than Photinia x frasery."

 "AbstractText": "Xylem cavitation resistance is a key physiological trait correlated with species tolerance to extreme drought stresses. Little is known about the genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity of this trait in natural tree populations. Here we measured the cavitation resistance of 17 Fagus sylvatica populations representative of the full range of the species in Europe. The trees were grown in three field trials under contrasting climatic conditions. Our findings suggest that the genotypic variability of cavitation resistance is high between genotypes of a given population. By contrast, no significant differences were found for this trait across populations, the mean population cavitation resistance being remarkably constant in each trial. We found a significant site effect and a significant site × population interaction, suggesting that cavitation resistance has a high phenotypic plasticity and that this plasticity is under genetic control. The implications of our findings for beech forest management in a context of climate change are discussed."

 "AbstractText": "The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a typically multi-layer tropical forest, while cerrado (savanna) is a patchy habitat with different physiognomy. Despite these differences, both habitats have high light heterogeneity. Functional traits of Dalbergia nigra and D. miscolobium from the Atlantic Forest and cerrado, respectively, were evaluated under shade (25% of full sunlight) and full sunlight in a nursery experiment. We hypothesised that both species should benefit from high phenotypic plasticity in relation to light. Plasticity was estimated using the relative distance phenotypic index (RDPI). D. miscolobium had lower shoot growth under both light conditions, suggesting it has low competitive capacity in the forest environment, which could explain its limited ability to expand over areas of Atlantic Forest. The studied species exhibited photoprotection strategies under high light and improved light capture under low light. Stomatal conductance, ETR(max) (maximum electron transport rate), PPFD(sat) (saturating photosynthetically active photon flux density), chlorophyll and carotenoid content had higher RDPI than stem morphological traits. Although both species showed considerable phenotypic plasticity, D. miscolobium had higher RDPI for eight of 11 evaluated traits. This high plasticity could be one of the factors that explain the occurrence of this species in a wide range of environmental conditions, from open grassland to dense woodlands, and it could also reflect its adaptation to high light. D. nigra also had considerable plasticity and good growth performance in both shade and full sunlight, but its absence in areas of cerrado suggests that factors other than light limit its occurrence in these habitats.",

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity refers to the ability of an organism to adopt different phenotypes depending on environmental conditions. In animals and plants, the progression of juvenile development and the formation of dormant stages are often associated with phenotypic plasticity, indicating the importance of phenotypic plasticity for life-history theory. Phenotypic plasticity has long been emphasized as a crucial principle in ecology and as facilitator of phenotypic evolution. In nematodes, several examples of phenotypic plasticity have been studied at the genetic and developmental level. In addition, the influence of different environmental factors has been investigated under laboratory conditions. These studies have provided detailed insight into the molecular basis of phenotypic plasticity and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Here, we review recent studies on the formation of dauer larvae in Caenorhabditis elegans, the evolution of nematode parasitism and the generation of a novel feeding trait in Pristionchus pacificus. These examples reveal a conserved and co-opted role of an endocrine signaling module involving the steroid hormone dafachronic acid. We will discuss how hormone signaling might facilitate life-history and morphological evolution.",

 "AbstractText": "Based on indirect evidence, it was previously suggested that shading could attenuate the negative impacts of drought on coffee (Coffea arabica), a tropical crop species native to shady environments. A variety (47) of morphological and physiological traits were examined in plants grown in 30-l pots in either full sunlight or 85% shade for 8 months, after which a 4-month water shortage was implemented. Overall, the traits showed weak or negligible responses to the light × water interaction, explaining less than 10% of the total data variation. Only slight variations in biomass allocation were observed in the combined shade and drought treatment. Differences in relative growth rates were mainly associated with physiological and not with morphological adjustments. In high light, drought constrained the photosynthetic rate through stomatal limitations with no sign of apparent photoinhibition; in low light, such constraints were apparently linked to biochemical factors. Sun-grown plants displayed osmotic adjustments, decreased tissue elasticities and improved long-term water use efficiencies, especially under drought. Regardless of the water availability, higher concentrations of lipids, total phenols, total soluble sugars and lignin were found in high light compared to shade conditions, in contrast to the effects on cellulose and hemicellulose concentrations. Proline concentrations increased in water-deprived plants, particularly those grown under full sun. Phenotypic plasticity was much higher in response to the light than to the water supply. Overall, shading did not alleviate the negative impacts of drought on the coffee tree.",

 "AbstractText": "Our understanding of plant growth in response to nitrogen (N) supply is mainly based on studies of mutants and transformants. This study explored the natural variability of Arabidopsis thaliana first to find out its global response to N availability and secondly to characterize the plasticity for growth and N metabolism among 23 genetically distant accessions under normal (N+), limited (N-), and starved (N0) N supplies. Plant growth was estimated by eight morphological traits characterizing shoot and root growth and 10 metabolic parameters that represented N and carbon metabolism. Most of the studied traits showed a large variation linked to genotype and nutrition. Furthermore, Arabidopsis growth was coordinated by master traits such as the shoot to root ratio of nitrate content in N+, root fresh matter and root amino acids in N-, and shoot fresh matter together with root thickness in N0. The 23 accessions could be gathered into four different groups, according to their growth in N+, N-, and N0. Phenotypic profiling characterized four different adaptative responses to N- and N0. Class 1 tolerated N limitation with the smallest decrease in shoot and root biomass compared with N+, while class 2 presented the highest resistance to N starvation by preferential increased root growth, huge starch accumulation, and high shoot nitrate content. In contrast, class 3 plants could tolerate neither N limitation nor N starvation. Small plants of class 4 were different, with shoot biomass barely affected in N- and root biomass unaffected in N0."

 "AbstractText": "The phenotypic responses of functional traits in natural populations are driven by genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity. These two mechanisms enable trees to cope with rapid climate change. We studied two European temperate tree species (sessile oak and European beech), focusing on (i) in situ variations of leaf functional traits (morphological and physiological) along two altitudinal gradients and (ii) the extent to which these variations were under environmental and/or genetic control using a common garden experiment. For all traits, altitudinal trends tended to be highly consistent between species and transects. For both species, leaf mass per area displayed a positive linear correlation with altitude, whereas leaf size was negatively correlated with altitude. We also observed a significant increase in leaf physiological performance with increasing altitude: populations at high altitudes had higher maximum rates of assimilation, stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen content than those at low altitudes. In the common garden experiment, genetic differentiation between populations accounted for 0-28% of total phenotypic variation. However, only two traits (leaf mass per area and nitrogen content) exhibited a significant cline. The combination of in situ and common garden experiments used here made it possible to demonstrate, for both species, a weaker effect of genetic variation than of variations in natural conditions, suggesting a strong effect of the environment on leaf functional traits. Finally, we demonstrated that intrapopulation variability was systematically higher than interpopulation variability, whatever the functional trait considered, indicating a high potential capacity to adapt to climate change."

 "AbstractText": "Hybrid necrosis sometimes appears in triploid hybrids between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii Coss. Two types of hybrid necrosis (type II and type III) were observed when cultivar Langdon was used as female parent for hybrid production. Type II necrosis symptoms occurred only under low temperature conditions, whereas bushy and dwarf phenotypes were observed under normal temperature conditions. The developmental plasticity might be related to a temperature-responsive alteration of meristematic activity at the crown tissue of triploid hybrids. Epistatic interaction between the AB and D genomes induced not only upregulation of a number of defense-related genes, but also extensive changes in plant architecture in the type II necrosis hybrids. Such phenotypic plasticity was also observed in other cross combinations between cultivated tetraploid wheat and type II necrosis-induced Ae. tauschii accessions. Wild tetraploid wheat, Triticum turgidum subspecies dicoccoides, did not induce type II necrosis in the triploid hybrids, indicating the possibility of identifying the chromosomal location of a causal gene for type II necrosis in the AB genome."

 "AbstractText": "There is increasing evidence that epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation contribute to phenotypic variation by regulating gene transcription, developmental plasticity, and interactions with the environment. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between the stability and distribution of DNA methylation within chromosomes and the ability to detect trait loci. Plant genomes have a distinct range of target sites and more extensive DNA methylation than animals. We analyzed the stability and distribution of epialleles within the complex genome of the oilseed crop plant Brassica napus. For methylation sensitive AFLP (MSAP) and retrotransposon (RT) epimarkers, we found a high degree of stability, with 90% of mapped markers retaining their allelic pattern in contrasting environments and developmental stages. Moreover, for two distinct parental lines 97% of epialleles were transmitted through five meioses and segregated in a mapping population. For the first time we have established the genetic position for 17 of the 19 centromeres within this amphidiploid species. Epiloci and genetic loci were distributed within distinct clusters, indicating differential detection of recombination events. This enabled us to identify additional significant QTL associated with seven important agronomic traits in the centromeric regions of five linkage groups."

 "AbstractText": "Plasticity allows for changes in phenotype in response to environmental cues, often facilitating local adaptation to seasonal environments. Phenotypic plasticity alone, however, may not always be sufficient to ensure adaptation to new localities. In particular, changing cues associated with shifting seasonal regimes may no longer induce appropriate phenotypic responses in new environments (Nicotra et al. 2010). Plastic responses must thus evolve to avoid being maladaptive. To date, the extent to which plastic responses can change and the genetic mechanisms by which this can happen have remained elusive. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Blackman et al. (2011a) harness natural variation in flowering time among populations of the wild sunflower, Helianthus annuus, to demonstrate that plasticity has indeed evolved in this species. Remarkably, they are able to detect changes in gene expression that are associated with both a loss of plasticity and a reversal of the plastic response. These changes occur in two separate, but integrated, regulatory pathways controlling the transition to flowering, suggesting that complex regulatory networks that incorporate multiple environmental and developmental cues may facilitate the evolution of plastic responses. This study leverages knowledge from plant genetic models to provide a surprising level of insight into the evolution of an adaptive trait in a non-model species. Through discoveries of the roles of gene duplication and network modularity in the evolution of plastic responses, the study raises questions about the degree to which species-specific network architectures may act as a constraint to the potential of adaptation.",

 "AbstractText": "The contributions of phenotypic plasticity to photosynthetic performance in winter (cv Musketeer, cv Norstar) and spring (cv SR4A, cv Katepwa) rye (Secale cereale) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars grown at either 20°C [non-acclimated (NA)] or 5°C [cold acclimated (CA)] were assessed. The 22-40% increase in light-saturated rates of CO₂ assimilation in CA vs NA winter cereals were accounted for by phenotypic plasticity as indicated by the dwarf phenotype and increased specific leaf weight. However, phenotypic plasticity could not account for (1) the differential temperature sensitivity of CO₂ assimilation and photosynthetic electron transport, (2) the increased efficiency and light-saturated rates of photosynthetic electron transport or (3) the decreased light sensitivity of excitation pressure and non-photochemical quenching between NA and NA winter cultivars. Cold acclimation decreased photosynthetic performance of spring relative to winter cultivars. However, the differences in photosynthetic performances between CA winter and spring cultivars were dependent upon the basis on which photosynthetic performance was expressed. Overexpression of BNCBF17 in Brassica napus generally decreased the low temperature sensitivity (Q₁₀) of CO₂ assimilation and photosynthetic electron transport even though the latter had not been exposed to low temperature. Photosynthetic performance in wild type compared to the BNCBF17-overexpressing transgenic B. napus indicated that CBFs/DREBs regulate not only freezing tolerance but also govern plant architecture, leaf anatomy and photosynthetic performance. The apparent positive and negative effects of cold acclimation on photosynthetic performance are discussed in terms of the apparent costs and benefits of phenotypic plasticity, winter survival and reproductive fitness.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In plants, prolonged dormancy is often considered a response to resource depletion or environmental stress that comes at a fitness cost. However, apparent costs of dormancy could reflect the state in which plants entered dormancy, rather than effects of dormancy per se. We tested this hypothesis for a terrestrial orchid, Epipactis atrorubens, by analyzing differences in vital rates of dormant and emergent plants using generalized linear mixed models, applied to eight years of demographic data. Dormant E. atrorubens plants did not form one homogeneous stage class. Instead, the vital rates of dormant plants mirrored performance of plants in their life stage before dormancy. Plants emerging from dormancy were slightly (albeit only marginally statistically significantly) larger than plants transitioning from the matching aboveground stage class, especially for smaller and younger stage classes. Because small plants were most likely to go dormant, plants emerging from dormancy were also smaller than average, if one were to compare all previously dormant plants to all previously emergent plants. Therefore, misclassifying all dormant plants into a single stage class changes whether we view dormancy as intrinsically costly, in terms of future performance upon emergence. We suggest that prolonged dormancy may be a form of phenotypic plasticity in which plants distribute their performance and reproductive effort through time, rather than a simple stress response."

 "text": "It is proposed that studying gene functions in naturally fluctuating conditions, or gene functions in natura, is important to predict responses to changing environments. First, we discuss flowering time, an extensively studied example of phenotypic plasticity. The quantitative approaches of ecological and evolutionary systems biology have been used to analyse the expression of a key flowering gene, FLC, of Arabidopsis halleri in naturally fluctuating environments. Modelling showed that FLC acts as a quantitative tracer of the temperature over the preceding 6 weeks. The predictions of this model were verified experimentally, confirming its applicability to future climate changes. Second, the evolution of self-compatibility as exemplifying an evolutionary response is discussed. Evolutionary genomic and functional analyses have indicated that A. thaliana became self-compatible via a loss-of-function mutation in the male specificity gene, SCR/SP11. Self-compatibility evolved during glacial-interglacial cycles, suggesting its association with mate limitation during migration. Although the evolution of self-compatibility may confer short-term advantages, it is predicted to increase the risk of extinction in the long term because loss-of-function mutations are virtually irreversible.",

 "text": "Self-fertilizing taxa are often found at the range margins of their progenitors, where sub-optimal habitats may select for alternative physiological strategies. The extent to which self-fertilization is favoured directly vs. arising indirectly through correlations with other adaptive life history traits is unclear. Trait responses to selection depend on genetic variation and covariation, as well as phenotypic and genetic responses to altered environmental conditions. We tested predictions of the hypothesis that self-fertilization in Mimulus arises through direct selection on physiological and developmental traits that allow seasonal drought escape.",

Inconsistent with predictions, selection for water-use efficiency was largely absent; selection for large flowers was stronger than for drought escape in the field; and most drought escape and mating system traits were not genetically correlated. A positive genetic correlation between flowering time and flower size, which opposed the adaptive contour, emerged only in wet soil, suggesting that variation in water availability may maintain variation in these traits. Plastic responses to soil moisture treatments supported the idea that taxonomic divergence could have been facilitated by plasticity in flowering time and selfing.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Ecologists have increasingly focused on how rapid adaptive trait changes can affect population dynamics. Rapid adaptation can result from either rapid evolution or phenotypic plasticity, but their effects on population dynamics are seldom compared directly. Here we examine theoretically the effects of rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity of antipredatory defense on predator-prey dynamics. Our analyses reveal that phenotypic plasticity tends to stabilize population dynamics more strongly than rapid evolution. It is therefore important to know the mechanism by which phenotypic variation is generated for predicting the dynamics of rapidly adapting populations. We next examine an advantage of a phenotypically plastic prey genotype over the polymorphism of specialist prey genotypes. Numerical analyses reveal that the plastic genotype, if there is a small cost for maintaining it, cannot coexist with the pairs of specialist counterparts unless the system has a limit cycle. Furthermore, for the plastic genotype to replace specialist genotypes, a forced environmental fluctuation is critical in a broad parameter range. When these results are combined, the plastic genotype enjoys an advantage with population oscillations, but plasticity tends to lose its advantage by stabilizing the oscillations. This dilemma leads to an interesting intermittent limit cycle with the changing frequency of phenotypic plasticity."

The occurrence of slightly different morphological types related to specific geographical distributions allows recognition of three additional taxa at the infraspecific level, D. cespitosa subsp. alpina, D. cespitosa subsp. beringensis, and D. brevifolia. All studied taxa showed morphological variation in a gradient, suggesting the existence of phenotypic plasticity.",

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is an important strategy for coping with changing environments. However, environmental change usually results in strong directional selection, and little is known empirically about how this affects plasticity. If genes affecting a trait value also affect its plasticity, selection on the trait should influence plasticity. Synthetic outbred populations of Arabidopsis thaliana were selected for earlier flowering under simulated spring- and winter-annual conditions to investigate the correlated response of flowering time plasticity and its effect on family-by-environment variance (Vg×e) within each selected line. We found that selection affected plasticity in an environmentally dependent manner: under simulated spring-annual conditions, selection increased the magnitude of plastic response but decreased Vg×e; selection under simulated winter-annual conditions reduced the magnitude of plastic response but did not alter Vg×e significantly. As selection may constrain future response to environmental change, the environment for crop breeding and ex situ conservation programmes should be carefully chosen. Models of species persistence under environmental change should also consider the interaction between selection and plasticity.",

Despite a large accumulation of evidence for female seed fertility advantages in gynodioecious species (females and hermaphrodites coexist) in support of the first step in the gynodioecy-dioecy pathway, we still have very little evidence for the second step, i.e. the transition from gynodioecy to dioecy.",

To establish whether females' seed fertility advantage and frequencies are sufficient to favour the invasion of males, we review these for species along the gynodioecy-dioecy pathway published in the last 5 years. We then review the empirical evidence for predictions deriving from the second step, i.e. hermaphrodites' male fertility increases with female frequency, selection favours greater male fertility in hermaphrodites in gynodioecious species, and, where males and hermaphrodites coexist with females (subdioecy), males have greater male fertility than hermaphrodites. We review how genetic control and certain ecological features (pollen limitation, selfing, plasticity in sex expression and antagonists) influence the trajectory of a population along the gynodioecy-dioecy pathway.",

 "text": "Females tend to have greater seed fertility advantages over hermaphrodites where the two coexist, and this advantage is positively correlated with female frequency across species, as predicted by theory. A limited number of studies in subdioecious species have demonstrated that males have an advantage over hermaphrodites, as also predicted by theory. However, less evidence exists for phenotypic selection to increase male traits of hermaphrodites or for increasing male function of hermaphrodites in populations with high female frequency. A few key case studies underline the importance of examining multiple components of male fertility and the roles of pollen limitation, selfing and plasticity, when evaluating advantages. We conclude that we do not yet have a full understanding of the transition from gynodioecy to dioecy.",

 "AbstractText": "The reproductive tillers of Elymus excelsus population in Songnen Plain were randomly marked with labels every other four days (five times in total) at early earring stage, and the marked tillers were harvested at dough stage, with the differences of their quantitative characteristics as well as the relationships between the quantitative characteristics and the shortened time of reproductive growth were analyzed. With the shortened time of reproductive growth, the quantitative characteristics of the reproductive tillers decreased gradually, which was not beneficial to the reproductive growth, reproductive allocation, and fruiting of reproductive tillers. The later the earring time, the larger the impact on fruiting and reproductive allocation was. When the reproductive growth time was shortened by 16 days, the grain biomass, setting penentage, reproductive allocation I , and reproductive allocation II decreased by 99.4%, 98.8%, 54.3%, and 99.2%, respectively. With the shortened time of reproductive growth, the tiller height decreased linearly, spike biomass, reproductive allocation I, and setting penentage decreased exponentially, tiller biomass, spike length, and floret number decreased powerly, and grain biomass, grain number, and reproductive allocation II decreased logarithmically."

 "AbstractText": "In this study, we report genome size variations in Corchorus olitorius L. (Malvaceae s.l.), a crop species known for its morphological plasticity and broad geographical distribution, and Corchorus capsularis L., the second widely cultivated species in the genus. Flow cytometric analyses were conducted with several tissues and nuclei isolation buffers using 69 accessions of C. olitorius and 4 accessions of C. capsularis, representing different habitats and geographical origins. The mean 2C nuclear DNA content (± SD) of C. olitorius was estimated to be 0.918 ± 0.011 pg, with a minimum of 0.882 ± 0.004 pg, and a maximum of 0.942 ± 0.004 pg. All studied plant materials were found to be diploid with 2n = 14. The genome size is negatively correlated with days to flowering (r = -0.29, p < 0.05) and positively with seed surface area (r = 0.38, p < 0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant positive correlation was detected between genome size and growing elevation (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) in wild populations. The mean 2C nuclear DNA content of C. capsularis was estimated to be 0.802 ± 0.008 pg. In comparison to other economically important crop species, the genome sizes of C. olitorius and C. capsularis are much smaller, and therewith closer to that of rice. The relatively small genome sizes will be of general advantage for any efforts into genomics or sequencing approaches of these species."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Vaccinium meridionale is a promising crop for the Andean region of South America and is currently available only in the wild. Spontaneous populations of this plant are found across the Colombian mountains, but very few published records on this plant morphology are available. A zonification study of V. meridionale was conducted in four principal areas of a low mountain forest of Colombia (Provinces of Boyacá, Cundinamarca, Santander and Nariño) in 2007. A total of 20 populations and 100 plants of V. meridionale were individually characterized and surveyed, using a list of 26 characters of morphological variables (9 quantitative and 17 qualitative characters). Our results indicated that natural populations of V. meridionale might be found in the tropical forest under a highly heterogeneous climate and microclimate conditions, at different mountain regions between 2 357 and 3 168masl. The shrubs of V. meridionale exhibited a high level of intra-population variation in several quantitative (plant height, stem diameter) and qualitative (growth habit, ramification density, presence of anthocyanins in stems) morphological characters, suggesting an environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity. Plant height, stem diameter and foliar density were the most variable morphological traits, with coefficients of variation higher than 50%. However, several quantitative characters of its reproductive potential, such as berry dimensions, rachis length and number of flowers per inflorescence, resulted with low plasticity with coefficients of variation lower than 30.2%, indicating that these characters were genetically determined. The highest correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) resulted to be between fruit length and fruit width (0.90), leaf length and leaf width (0.78), plant height and stem diameter (0.60), and inflorescence length and flowers number per inflorescence (0.57). The results suggest that an important genetic resource exists for this species in the wild. Low variation in fruit size, which constitutes a target trait for plant breeders, could be useful for selection of cultivars of V. meridionale. The results of this study could also be applied in conservation programs aimed to protect these diverse populations in the mountain forests of Colombia."

 "AbstractText": "Pantoea agglomerans E325, the active ingredient in a commercial product for fire blight control, was previously shown in vitro to produce a unique alkaline- and phosphate-sensitive antibiotic specific to Erwinia amylovora. Antibiosis was evaluated as a mode of antagonism on flower stigmas using two antibiosis-deficient mutants. On King's medium B, mutants E325ad1 and E325ad2 have stable smooth-butyrous or hypermucoid colony morphologies, respectively, and the parental strain E325 exhibits phenotypic plasticity with predominantly hypermucoid colonies accompanied by slower-growing, smooth-butyrous colonies. Mutants were tested against E. amylovora on stigmas of detached flowers of crab apple (Malus mandshurica) in growth chambers and apple (Malus domestica) in the orchard. Epiphytic fitness of the antibiosis-negative mutants was similar or greater than the parental strain as determined by relative area under the population curve (RAUPC). In laboratory and orchard trials, both mutants had significantly lower inhibitory activity against the pathogen (i.e., less reduction of E. amylovora RAUPC) compared with the parental strain. E325 and the mutants caused similar decreases in pH in a broth medium, indicating that acidification, which was previously reported as a possible mechanism of pathogen inhibition on stigmas, is not directly related to antibiosis. In this study we provide the first evidence for E325 antibiosis involved in E. amylovora growth suppression on apple flower stigmas."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Species living in seasonal environments often adaptively time their reproduction in response to photoperiod cues. We characterized the expression of genes in the flowering-time regulatory network across wild populations of the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, that we found to be adaptively differentiated for photoperiod response. The observed clinal variation was associated with changes at multiple hierarchical levels in multiple pathways. Paralogue-specific changes in FT homologue expression and tissue-specific changes in SOC1 homologue expression were associated with loss and reversal of plasticity, respectively, suggesting that redundancy and modularity are gene network characteristics easily exploited by natural selection to produce evolutionary innovation. Distinct genetic mechanisms contribute to convergent evolution of photoperiod responses within sunflower, suggesting regulatory network architecture does not impose strong constraints on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.",

 "AbstractText": "Plant volatiles typically occur as a complex mixture of low-molecular weight lipophilic compounds derived from different biosynthetic pathways, and are seemingly produced as part of a defense strategy against biotic and abiotic stress, as well as contributing to various physiological functions of the producer organism. The biochemistry and molecular biology of plant volatiles is complex, and involves the interplay of several biochemical pathways and hundreds of genes. All plants are able to store and emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the process shows remarkable genotypic variation and phenotypic plasticity. From a physiological standpoint, plant volatiles are involved in three critical processes, namely plant–plant interaction, the signaling between symbiotic organisms, and the attraction of pollinating insects. Their role in these ‘‘housekeeping’’ activities underlies agricultural applications that range from the search for sustainable methods for pest control to the production of flavors and fragrances. On the other hand, there is also growing evidence that VOCs are endowed with a range of biological activities in mammals, and that they represent a substantially under-exploited and still largely untapped source of novel drugs and drug leads. This review summarizes recent major developments in the study of biosynthesis, ecological functions and medicinal applications of plant VOCs."

 "AbstractText": "Adaptive phenotypic plasticity and adaptive genetic differentiation enable plant lineages to maximize their fitness in response to environmental heterogeneity. The spatial scale of environmental variation relative to the average dispersal distance of a species determines whether selection will favor plasticity, local adaptation, or an intermediate strategy. Habitats where the spatial scale of environmental variation is less than the dispersal distance of a species are fine grained and should favor the expression of adaptive plasticity, while coarse-grained habitats, where environmental variation occurs on spatial scales greater than dispersal, should favor adaptive genetic differentiation. However, there is relatively little information available characterizing the link between the spatial scale of environmental variation and patterns of selection on plasticity measured in the field. I examined patterns of spatial environmental variation within a serpentine mosaic grassland and selection on an annual plant (Erodium cicutarium) within that landscape. Results indicate that serpentine soil patches are a significantly finer-grained habitat than non-serpentine patches. Additionally, selection generally favored increased plasticity on serpentine soils and diminished plasticity on non-serpentine soils. This is the first empirical example of differential selection for phenotypic plasticity in the field as a result of strong differences in the grain of environmental heterogeneity within habitats."

 "AbstractText": "Conceptual models accounting for the influence of source:sink ratio on water relations of trees are theoretically relevant from a physiological perspective and practically important for irrigation scheduling. Midday stem water potential of horticultural trees often declines with increasing crop load but the actual response depends on environmental, management and plant factors. Here we advance a quantitative synthesis of the response of stem water potential to crop load from the perspective of phenotypic plasticity, defined as 'the amount by which the expression of individual characteristics of a genotype are changed by different environments'. Data sets of stem water potential for contrasting crop loads were compiled for apple (Malus domestica L. Borkh.), olive (Olea europea L.), peach (Prunus persica L.), pear (Pyrus communis L.) and plum (Prunus domestica L.). Phenotypic plasticity of stem water potential was calculated as the slope of the linear regression between stem water potential for each crop load and the environmental mean of stem water potential across crop loads. Regression lines for trees with different crop load diverged with decreasing environmental mean stem water potential. For the pooled data, plasticity of stem water potential was a linear function of relative crop load. This represents a significant shift in perspective: the effect of crop load on the trait per se (stem water potential) is environmentally contingent, but the effect of crop load on the plasticity of the trait is not. We conclude that research on the effects of crop load on tree water relations would return more robust results if plant traits are considered from the dual perspective of the trait per se and its plasticity.",

 "AbstractText": "• Premise of the study: Genome duplication and interspecific hybridization are important evolutionary processes that significantly influence phenotypic variation, ecological behavior, and reproductive biology of land plants. These processes played a major role in the evolution of the Dryopteris carthusiana complex. This taxonomically intricate group composed of one diploid (D. expansa) and two allotetraploid (D. carthusiana and D. dilatata) species in Central Europe. Overall phenotypic similarity, great plasticity, and the incidence of interspecific hybrids have led to a continuous dispute concerning species circumscription and delimitation. • Methods: We used flow cytometry and multivariate morphometrics to assess the level of phenotypic variation and the frequency of hybridization in a representative set covering all recognized species and hybrids. • Key results: Flow cytometric measurements revealed unique genome sizes in all species and hybrids, allowing their easy and reliable identification for subsequent morphometric analyses. Different species often formed mixed populations, providing the opportunity for interspecific hybridization. Different frequencies of particular hybrid combinations depended primarily on evolutionary relationships, reproductive biology, and co-occurrence of progenitors. • Conclusions: Our study shows that genome size is a powerful marker for taxonomic decisions about the D. carthusiana complex and that genome size data may help to resolve taxonomic complexities in this important component of the temperate fern flora."

 "AbstractText": "Lodgepole pines, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson, are encountering increased abiotic stress and pest activity due to recent increases in temperature and changes in precipitation throughout their range. This tree species counters these threats by producing secondary metabolites, including phenolics and terpenoids. We examined foliar levels of lignin, soluble phenolics, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpenoids in 12 stands in British Columbia, Canada. We used these data to assess associations among foliar secondary metabolite levels and ecosystem, geographic, and climatic variables. Regressions were also performed to observe which combinations of variables best explained secondary metabolite variance. Stands of P. c. latifolia in the Coastal Western Hemlock and Interior Cedar/Hemlock biogeoclimatic zones had consistently greater foliar levels of almost all measured secondary metabolites than did other stands. Lignin was present in greater amounts in Boreal White/Black Spruce ecosystem (i.e., northern) stands than in southern stands, suggesting a role for this metabolite in pine survival in the boreal forest. Attempts to develop regression models with geographic and climatic variables to explain foliar secondary metabolite levels resulted in multiple models with similar predictive capability. Since foliar secondary metabolite levels appeared to vary most between stand ecosystem types and not as much due to geographic and climatic variables, metabolic profiles appeared best matched to the stress levels within local environments. It is unknown if differences in secondary metabolite levels are the result of genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, but results from this and other studies suggest that both are important. These results are interpreted in light of ongoing efforts to assist in the migration of certain populations of P. c. latifolia northward in an effort to counter predicted effects of climate change."

 "text": "Hybridization and polyploidy are potent forces that have regularly stimulated plant evolution and adaptation. Dactylorhiza majalis s.s., D. traunsteineri s.l. and D. ebudensis are three allopolyploid species of a polyploid complex formed through unidirectional (and, in the first two cases, recurrent) hybridization between the widespread diploids D. fuchsii and D. incarnata. Differing considerably in geographical extent and ecological tolerance, the three allopolyploids together provide a useful system to explore genomic responses to allopolyploidization and reveal their role in adaptation to contrasting environments.",

 "text": "Analyses of cDNA-AFLPs show a significant increase in the range of gene expression of these allopolyploid lineages, demonstrating higher potential for phenotypic plasticity than is shown by either parent. Moreover, allopolyploid individuals express significantly more gene variants (including novel alleles) than their parents, providing clear evidence of increased biological complexity following allopolyploidization. More genetic mutations seem to have accumulated in the older D. majalis compared with the younger D. traunsteineri since their respective formation.",

"AbstractText": {
 "text": "Multiple origins of the polyploids contribute to differential patterns of gene expression with a distinct geographic structure. However, several transcripts conserved within each allopolyploid taxon differ between taxa, indicating that habitat preferences shape similar expression patterns in these independently formed tetraploids. Statistical signals separate several transcripts - some of them novel in allopolyploids - that appear correlated with adaptive traits and seem to play a role favouring the persistence of individuals in their native environments. In addition to stabilizing the allopolyploid genome, genetic and epigenetic alterations are key determinants of adaptive success of the new polyploid species after recurrent allopolyploidization events, potentially triggering reproductive isolation between the resulting lineages.",

 "AbstractText": "Inducible defensive traits against herbivores or predators are widespread in plants and animals. Theory predicts that defended morphs have greater fitness in the presence of predators, but lower fitness than undefended morphs in the absence of predators. If such costs did not exist, then a constitutively defended morph would be favored by natural selection; yet, evidence for such costs has been elusive. Our current work reveals a significant cost to inducible defenses. Using the waterflea (Daphnia) model system, we show that induced defended morphs are significantly more vulnerable to infection by a virulent yeast parasite than undefended morphs. In two independent experiments, the proportion of successful infections and the number of parasite spores were higher among defended versus undefended Daphnia. Thus, by demonstrating a previously unknown and environmentally relevant cost to inducible defenses, this study enhances our understanding of adaptive phenotypic plasticity and its evolution.",

 "AbstractText": "Plants use different strategies to deal with high soil salinity. One strategy is activation of pathways that allow the plant to export or compartmentalise salt. Relying on their phenotypic plasticity, plants can also adjust their root system architecture (RSA) and the direction of root growth to avoid locally high salt concentrations. Here, we highlight RSA responses to salt and osmotic stress and the underlying mechanisms. A model is presented that describes how salinity affects auxin distribution in the root. Possible intracellular signalling pathways linking salinity to root development and direction of root growth are discussed. These involve perception of high cytosolic Na+ concentrations in the root, activation of lipid signalling and protein kinase activity and modulation of endocytic pathways.",

 "AbstractText": "'The Holy Grail' of plant ecology is to uncover rules that associate species and traits with environmental constraints, community composition and subsequent ecosystem functioning. These aims have been crystallized in recent years within the context of global climate change and environmental pollution, increasing the urgency of the need to predict how vegetation will respond across spatial scales. We investigated whether genetic diversity is associated with the way in which phenotypic plasticity within plant populations is realized and whether this is related to genotype abundance. We used environmental metabolomics to demonstrate biochemical variation between co-occurring genotypes of Carex caryophyllea L. A novel combined metabolomic/functional trait analysis was used to test the functionality of this variation in governing plasticity to variation in edaphic conditions, with particular reference to metabolic pathways that play important roles in growth-related traits. We show that genetic diversity within a wild C. caryophyllea population relates to differences in metabolic composition and functional traits in response to soil nutrient variation, influencing genotype abundance within a community. Our findings highlight the vital role genetic diversity plays within a population in facilitating plant phenotypic plasticity and the potential usefulness of environmental metabolomics to future ecological studies.",

 "AbstractText": "Globularia alypum is a perennial shrub typical of western Mediterranean thermophilous shrublands. Nine populations of G. alypum located in different localities of Catalonia (NE Spain) were surveyed for flowering phenology. Flower-head buds were present in all the populations in July. Flowering time in the area spans from the late summer-early autumn to the next spring depending on the populations; there are two groups of populations, early and late flowering. Early populations grow mostly in coastal localities and flower from September to November, whereas late flowering populations grow in inland localities and flower from February to April. The flowering order of the populations correlated with minimum temperature of most months except the warmest ones, and correlated with maximum and mean temperatures of the coldest months. Correlations were similar when tested with annual climate. The flowering order also correlated with the thermic interval for most months except the coldest and with the index of continentality. Early populations alone did not present correlations with any variable, whereas late populations alone correlated similarly to all populations together. Flowering order did not correlate with precipitation. Late populations are proposed to be regulated by temperature according to our results whereas early populations could be regulated by timing in precipitation after summer drought, according to published results. We discuss the possibilities of the two flowering patterns, early and late, being due to phenotypic plasticity or to genetic adaptation to local climates. We also discuss the consequences at the plant and ecosystem level of climate warming causing shifts from late to early patterns, a possibility that is likely in the warmest of the late populations if flowering is modulated phenotypically."

 "AbstractText": "Community genetic studies generally ignore the plasticity of the functional traits through which the effect is passed from individuals to the associated community. However, the ability of organisms to be phenotypically plastic allows them to rapidly adapt to changing environments and plasticity is commonly observed across all taxa. Owing to the fitness benefits of phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary biologists are interested in its genetic basis, which could explain how phenotypic plasticity is involved in the evolution of species interactions. Two current ideas exist: (i) phenotypic plasticity is caused by environmentally sensitive loci associated with a phenotype; (ii) phenotypic plasticity is caused by regulatory genes that simply influence the plasticity of a phenotype. Here, we designed a quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping experiment to locate QTL on the barley genome associated with barley performance when the environment varies in the presence of aphids, and the composition of the rhizosphere. We simultaneously mapped aphid performance across variable rhizosphere environments. We mapped main effects, QTL × environment interaction (QTL×E), and phenotypic plasticity (measured as the difference in mean trait values) for barley and aphid performance onto the barley genome using an interval mapping procedure. We found that QTL associated with phenotypic plasticity were co-located with main effect QTL and QTL×E. We also located phenotypic plasticity QTL that were located separately from main effect QTL. These results support both of the current ideas of how phenotypic plasticity is genetically based and provide an initial insight into the functional genetic basis of how phenotypically plastic traits may still be important sources of community genetic effects."

 "text": "Laboratory-constructed yeast hybrids, one intraspecific Saccharomyces cerevisiae × S. cerevisiae and three interspecific S. cerevisiae × Saccharomyces bayanus, were subcultured in aerobic or anaerobic conditions in media with or without l-malic acid. Changes in the biochemical profiles, karyotypes and mitochondrial DNA profiles of the segregates were assessed after 50-190 generations. All yeast segregates showed a tendency to increase the range of the tested compounds utilized as sole carbon sources. Interspecific hybrids were alloaneuploid and their genomes tended to undergo extensive rearrangement especially during fermentation. The karyotypes of segregates lost up to four and appearance up to five bands were recorded. The changes in their mtDNA patterns were even broader reaching 12 missing and six additional bands. These hybrids acquired the ability to sporulate and significantly changed their biochemical profiles. The alloaneuploid intraspecific S. cerevisiae hybrid was characterized by high genetic stability despite the phenotypic changes. L-malic acid was not found to affect the extent of genomic changes of the hybrids, which suggests that their demalication ability is combined with resistance to acidic stress.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a key regulator of epigenetic states catalyzing histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark. PRC2 composition is conserved from humans to plants, but the function of PRC2 during the early stage of plant life is unclear beyond the fact that it is required for the development of endosperm, a nutritive tissue that supports embryo growth. Circumventing the requirement of PRC2 in endosperm allowed us to generate viable homozygous null mutants for FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), which is the single Arabidopsis homolog of Extra Sex Combs, an indispensable component of Drosophila and mammalian PRC2. Here we show that H3K27me3 deposition is abolished genome-wide in fie mutants demonstrating the essential function of PRC2 in placing this mark in plants as in animals. In contrast to animals, we find that PRC2 function is not required for initial body plan formation in Arabidopsis. Rather, our results show that fie mutant seeds exhibit enhanced dormancy and germination defects, indicating a deficiency in terminating the embryonic phase. After germination, fie mutant seedlings switch to generative development that is not sustained, giving rise to neoplastic, callus-like structures. Further genome-wide studies showed that only a fraction of PRC2 targets are transcriptionally activated in fie seedlings and that this activation is accompanied in only a few cases with deposition of H3K4me3, a mark associated with gene activity and considered to act antagonistically to H3K27me3. Up-regulated PRC2 target genes were found to act at different hierarchical levels from transcriptional master regulators to a wide range of downstream targets. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PRC2-mediated regulation represents a robust system controlling developmental phase transitions, not only from vegetative phase to flowering but also especially from embryonic phase to the seedling stage."

 "AbstractText": "The aims of this work were to quantify (i) the effect of the source:sink ratio on stem water potential (SWP) and (ii) the phenotypic plasticity of SWP and its relationship to oil yield components in olive. Trees with a 3-fold variation in the source:sink ratio (crown volume/fruit number per tree) were monitored in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 in a fully irrigated orchard in Mendoza, Argentina. The combination of rainfall, irrigation, and evaporative demand led to a steady SWP largely above -1.65 MPa in 2007-2008 and a marked seasonal decline from -1.13 MPa to -2.04 MPa in trees with a medium and low source:sink ratio in 2008-2009. Plasticity was quantified as the slope of the norm of reaction for each trait. Across seasons, trees with a high source:sink ratio had a higher SWP than their counterparts with a medium and low source:sink ratio. Plasticity of SWP was highest in olives with a low source:sink ratio (slope=1.28) and lowest for trees with a high source:sink ratio (slope=0.76). The average SWP for each source:sink ratio and season was unrelated to both the source:sink ratio and yield components. On the other hand, the plasticity of SWP was positively associated with fruit number and negatively associated with the source:sink ratio, fruit weight, and fruit oil weight. The plasticity of the SWP was unrelated to SWP per se. It is concluded that understanding the effect of the source:sink ratio on plant water relations would benefit from a dual perspective considering the trait per se and its plasticity. A dual approach would also allow for more robust plant-based indicators for irrigation."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "A fundamental limitation in many climate change experiments is that tests represent relatively short-term 'shock' experiments and so do not incorporate the phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary change that may occur during the gradual process of climate change. However, capturing this aspect of climate change effects in an experimental design is a difficult challenge that few studies have accomplished. I examined the effect of temperature and predator climate history in food webs composed of herbaceous plants, generalist grasshopper herbivores and spider predators across a natural 4.8°C temperature gradient spanning 500 km in northeastern USA. In these grasslands, the effects of rising temperatures on the plant community are indirect and arise via altered predator-herbivore interactions. Experimental warming had no direct effect on grasshoppers, but reduced predation risk effects by causing spiders from all study sites to seek thermal refuge lower in the plant canopy. However, spider thermal tolerance corresponded to spider origin such that spiders from warmer study sites tolerated higher temperatures than spiders from cooler study sites. As a consequence, the magnitude of the indirect effect of spiders on plants did not differ along the temperature gradient, although a reciprocal transplant experiment revealed significantly different effects of spider origin on the magnitude of top-down control. These results suggest that variation in predator response to warming may maintain species interactions and associated food web processes when faced with long term, chronic climate warming."

 "AbstractText": "Flagella-generated fluid stirring has been suggested to enhance nutrient uptake for sufficiently large micro-organisms, and to have played a role in evolutionary transitions to multicellularity. A corollary to this predicted size-dependent benefit is a propensity for phenotypic plasticity in the flow-generating mechanism to appear in large species under nutrient deprivation. We examined four species of volvocalean algae whose radii and flow speeds differ greatly, with Péclet numbers (Pe) separated by several orders of magnitude. Populations of unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and one- to eight-celled Gonium pectorale (Pe ∼ 0.1-1) and multicellular Volvox carteri and Volvox barberi (Pe ∼ 100) were grown in diluted and undiluted media. For C. reinhardtii and G. pectorale, decreasing the nutrient concentration resulted in smaller cells, but had no effect on flagellar length and propulsion force. In contrast, these conditions induced Volvox colonies to grow larger and increase their flagellar length, separating the somatic cells further. Detailed studies on V. carteri found that the opposing effects of increasing beating force and flagellar spacing balance, so the fluid speed across the colony surface remains unchanged between nutrient conditions. These results lend further support to the hypothesized link between the Péclet number, nutrient uptake and the evolution of biological complexity in the Volvocales."

 "AbstractText": "Competition and parasitism are two important selective forces that shape life-histories, migration rates and population dynamics. Recently, it has been shown in various pathosystems that parasites can modify intraspecific competition, thus generating an indirect cost of parasitism. Here, we investigated if this phenomenon was present in a plant-potyvirus system using two viruses of different virulence (Tobacco etch virus and Turnip mosaic virus). Moreover, we asked if parasitism interacted with the shade avoidance syndrome, the plant-specific phenotypic plasticity in response to intraspecific competition. Our results indicate that the modification of intraspecific competition by parasitism is not present in the Nicotiana benthamiana--potyvirus system and suggests that this phenomenon is not universal but depends on the peculiarities of each pathosystem. However, whereas the healthy N. benthamiana presented a clear shade avoidance syndrome, this phenotypic plasticity totally disappeared when the plants were infected with TEV and TuMV, very likely resulting in a fitness loss and being another form of indirect cost of parasitism. This result suggests that the suppression or the alteration of adaptive phenotypic plasticity might be a component of virulence that is often overlooked."

 "AbstractText": "Plant physiological adaptation to the global rise in atmospheric CO(2) concentration (CO(2)) is identified as a crucial climatic forcing. To optimize functioning under rising CO(2), plants reduce the diffusive stomatal conductance of their leaves (g(s)) dynamically by closing stomata and structurally by growing leaves with altered stomatal densities and pore sizes. The structural adaptations reduce maximal stomatal conductance (g(smax)) and constrain the dynamic responses of g(s). Here, we develop and validate models that simulate structural stomatal adaptations based on diffusion of CO(2) and water vapor through stomata, photosynthesis, and optimization of carbon gain under the constraint of a plant physiological cost of water loss. We propose that the ongoing optimization of g(smax) is eventually limited by species-specific limits to phenotypic plasticity. Our model reproduces observed structural stomatal adaptations and predicts that adaptation will continue beyond double CO(2). Owing to their distinct stomatal dimensions, angiosperms reach their phenotypic response limits on average at 740 ppm and conifers on average at 1,250 ppm CO(2). Further, our simulations predict that doubling today's CO(2) will decrease the annual transpiration flux of subtropical vegetation in Florida by ≈60 W·m(-2). We conclude that plant adaptation to rising CO(2) is altering the freshwater cycle and climate and will continue to do so throughout this century."

 "AbstractText": "A principle response of C3 plants to increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) (CO(2)) is to reduce transpirational water loss by decreasing stomatal conductance (g(s)) and simultaneously increase assimilation rates. Via this adaptation, vegetation has the ability to alter hydrology and climate. Therefore, it is important to determine the adaptation of vegetation to the expected anthropogenic rise in CO(2). Short-term stomatal opening-closing responses of vegetation to increasing CO(2) are described by free-air carbon enrichments growth experiments, and evolutionary adaptations are known from the geological record. However, to date the effects of decadal to centennial CO(2) perturbations on stomatal conductance are still largely unknown. Here we reconstruct a 34% (±12%) reduction in maximum stomatal conductance (g(smax)) per 100 ppm CO(2) increase as a result of the adaptation in stomatal density (D) and pore size at maximal stomatal opening (a(max)) of nine common species from Florida over the past 150 y. The species-specific g(smax) values are determined by different evolutionary development, whereby the angiosperms sampled generally have numerous small stomata and high g(smax), and the conifers and fern have few large stomata and lower g(smax). Although angiosperms and conifers use different D and a(max) adaptation strategies, our data show a coherent response in g(smax) to CO(2) rise of the past century. Understanding these adaptations of C3 plants to rising CO(2) after decadal to centennial environmental changes is essential for quantification of plant physiological forcing at timescales relevant for global warming, and they are likely to continue until the limits of their phenotypic plasticity are reached."

 "AbstractText": "Do invasive plant species have greater phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species? And, if so, how does this affect their fitness relative to native, non-invasive species? What role might this play in plant invasions? To answer these long-standing questions, we conducted a meta-analysis using data from 75 invasive/non-invasive species pairs. Our analysis shows that invasive species demonstrate significantly higher phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species. To examine the adaptive benefit of this plasticity, we plotted fitness proxies against measures of plasticity in several growth, morphological and physiological traits to test whether greater plasticity is associated with an improvement in estimated fitness. Invasive species were nearly always more plastic in their response to greater resource availability than non-invasives but this plasticity was only sometimes associated with a fitness benefit. Intriguingly, non-invasive species maintained greater fitness homoeostasis when comparing growth between low and average resource availability. Our finding that invasive species are more plastic in a variety of traits but that non-invasive species respond just as well, if not better, when resources are limiting, has interesting implications for predicting responses to global change.",

 "AbstractText": "• A key question in ecological genetics is to what extent do plants adapt to changes in climatic conditions, such as drought, through plasticity or evolution. • To address this question, seeds of 140 maternal families of Brassica rapa were generated from collections made before (1997) and after (2004) a natural drought. These seeds were planted in the glasshouse and grown under low-water and high-water conditions. • Post-drought lines flowered earlier than pre-drought lines, showing an evolutionary shift to earlier flowering. There was significant genetic variation and genotype by environment (G × E) interactions in flowering time, indicating genetic variation in plasticity in this trait. Plants that flowered earlier had fewer leaf nodes and lower instantaneous (A/g) and integrated (δ(13) C) water use efficiency than late-flowering plants. • These results suggest that B. rapa plants escape drought through early flowering rather than avoid drought through increased water use efficiency. The mechanism of this response appears to be high transpiration and inefficient water use, leading to rapid development. These findings demonstrate a trade-off between drought avoidance and escape, and indicate that, in this system, where drought acts to shorten the growing season, selection for drought escape through earlier flowering is more important than phenotypic plasticity.",

 "AbstractText": "Plant-microbe interactions are ubiquitous. Plants are threatened by pathogens, but they are even more commonly engaged in neutral or mutualistic interactions with microbes: belowground microbial plant associates are mycorrhizal fungi, Rhizobia, and plant-growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria, aboveground plant parts are colonized by internally living bacteria and fungi (endophytes) and by microbes in the phyllosphere (epiphytes). We emphasize here that a completely microbe-free plant is an exotic exception rather than the biologically relevant rule. The complex interplay of such microbial communities with the host-plant affects multiple vital parameters such as plant nutrition, growth rate, resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors, and plant survival and distribution. The mechanisms involved reach from direct ones such as nutrient acquisition, the production of plant hormones, or direct antibiosis, to indirect ones that are mediated by effects on host resistance genes or via interactions at higher trophic levels. Plant-associated microbes are heterotrophic and cause costs to their host plant, whereas the benefits depend on the current environment. Thus, the outcome of the interaction for the plant host is highly context dependent. We argue that considering the microbe-free plant as the \"normal\" or control stage significantly impairs research into important phenomena such as (1) phenotypic and epigenetic plasticity, (2) the \"normal\" ecological outcome of a given interaction, and (3) the evolution of plants. For the future, we suggest cultivation-independent screening methods using direct PCR from plant tissue of more than one fungal and bacterial gene to collect data on the true microbial diversity in wild plants. The patterns found could be correlated to host species and environmental conditions, in order to formulate testable hypotheses on the biological roles of plant endophytes in nature. Experimental approaches should compare different host-endophyte combinations under various relevant environmental conditions and study at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, and physiological level the parameters that cause the interaction to shift along the mutualism-parasitism continuum."

 "AbstractText": "Nonnative species richness typically declines along environmental gradients such as elevation. It is usually assumed that this is because few invaders possess the necessary adaptations to succeed under extreme environmental conditions. Here, we show that nonnative plants reaching high elevations around the world are not highly specialized stress tolerators but species with broad climatic tolerances capable of growing across a wide elevational range. These results contrast with patterns for native species, and they can be explained by the unidirectional expansion of nonnative species from anthropogenic sources at low elevations and the progressive dropping out of species with narrow elevational amplitudes--a process that we call directional ecological filtering. Independent data confirm that climatic generalists have succeeded in colonizing the more extreme environments at higher elevations. These results suggest that invasion resistance is not conferred by extreme conditions at a particular site but determined by pathways of introduction of nonnative species. In the future, increased direct introduction of nonnative species with specialized ecophysiological adaptations to mountain environments could increase the risk of invasion. As well as providing a general explanation for gradients of nonnative species richness and the importance of traits such as phenotypic plasticity for many invasive species, the concept of directional ecological filtering is useful for understanding the initial assembly of some native floras at high elevations and latitudes."

We used 405,466 diagnostic features on tiling microarrays to recognize At and Aa contributions to the As genome and transcriptome: 324 genes lacked Aa contributions and 614 genes lacked At contributions within As. In leaf tissues, 3,458 genes preferentially expressed At homoeologs while 4,150 favored Aa homoeologs. These patterns were validated with resequencing. Genes with preferential use of Aa homoeologs were enriched for expression functions, consistent with the dominance of Aa transcription. Heterologous networks--mixed from At and Aa transcripts--were underrepresented.",

"AbstractText": {
 "text": "Thousands of deleted and silenced homoeologs in the genome of As were identified. Since heterologous networks may be compromised by interspecies incompatibilities, these networks evolve co-biases, expressing either only Aa or only At homoeologs. This progressive change towards predominantly pure parental networks might contribute to phenotypic variability and plasticity, and enable the species to exploit a larger range of environments.",

 "AbstractText": "Aphids show a marked phenotypic plasticity, producing asexual or sexual and winged or wingless morphs depending on environmental conditions and season. We describe here the general structure of the brain of various morphs of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. This is the first detailed anatomical study of the central nervous system of an aphid by immunocytochemistry (synapsin, serotonin, and several neuropeptides), ethyl-gallate staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and three-dimensional reconstructions. The study has revealed well-developed optic lobes composed of lamina, medulla, and lobula complex. Ocelli are only present in males and winged parthenogenetic females. The central complex is well-defined, with a central body divided into two parts, a protocerebral bridge, and affiliated lateral accessory lobes. The mushroom bodies are ill-defined, lacking calyces, and only being visualized by using an antiserum against the neuropeptide orcokinin. The antennal lobes contain poorly delineated glomeruli but can be clearly visualized by performing antennal backfills. On the basis of our detailed description of the brain of winged and wingless parthenogenetic A. pisum females, an anatomical map is now available that should improve our knowledge of the way that these structures are involved in the regulation of phenotypic plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Microarray analysis and new sequencing technologies have revealed that the majority of the genome is transcribed in many eukaryotes. Much of the RNA appears to be non-coding and an ongoing debate is how much of a functional role it has. Different mechanisms by which ncRNA can be regulatory have been described: direct ncRNA effects on transcription; recruitment of chromatin modifiers; formation of silent nuclear compartments. These have been documented chiefly in yeasts and mammals but examples are now appearing in plants. To date RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing studies in plants have focused on siRNAs, but data now show longer ncRNAs are also involved in this silencing. Roles for long ncRNAs in the phenotypic plasticity of plants are also suggested by whole genome analysis showing widespread effects of different external cues on ncRNA expression.",

 "AbstractText": "Increased importance of genetic drift and selection for stress resistance have been predicted to lead to a reduction in the degree of phenotypic plasticity in populations at margins of a species' geographical range, relative to those in the centre. We examined the effect of population positioning within the species range on degree of active morphological plasticity to vegetation shade. Importantly, we discriminated between active, size-independent morphological adjustments in response to shade and passive changes in morphology caused by the dependence of morphological traits on plant size, as only the former are considered to be adaptive. Two closely related and ecologically similar Agrimonia species were examined in the same geographical location, where one species reaches the edge of its distribution (Agrimonia pilosa) and the other does not (A. eupatoria). Plasticity to light availability is likely to be advantageous for both species as they occupy habitats with variable light conditions. However, we hypothesised that high levels of environmental stress should lead to reduced active plasticity in marginal compared with more central populations. Agrimonia eupatoria exhibited active adjustments in leaf morphology in response to tree shade, and in elongation of stems and inflorescences in response to herbaceous shade. In contrast, A. pilosa exhibited very limited active plasticity. High active plasticity allowed A. eupatoria to retain constant shoot growth in a wide range of light conditions, while the lack of active plasticity in A. pilosa resulted in a strong dependence of shoot growth on light availability. We propose that high levels of environmental stress in marginal areas of a species' range may lead to a significant reduction in the degree of active plasticity. Our results clearly indicate that discrimination between active and passive plasticity is crucial for reaching valid conclusions about differences in adaptive plasticity between marginal and non-marginal populations.",

 "AbstractText": "Plant growth and proliferation control is coming into a global focus due to recent ecological and economical developments. Plants represent not only the largest food supply for mankind but also may serve as a global source of renewable energies. However, plant breeding has to accomplish a tremendous boost in yield to match the growing demand of a still rapidly increasing human population. Moreover, breeding has to adjust to changing environmental conditions, in particular increased drought. Regulation of cell-cycle control is a major determinant of plant growth and therefore an obvious target for plant breeding. Furthermore, cell-cycle control is also crucial for the DNA damage response, for instance upon irradiation. Thus, an in-depth understanding of plant cell-cycle regulation is of importance beyond a scientific point of view. The mere presence of many conserved core cell-cycle regulators, e.g. CDKs, cyclins, or CDK inhibitors, has formed the idea that the cell cycle in plants is exactly or at least very similarly controlled as in yeast or human cells. Here together with a recent publication we demonstrate that this dogma is not true and show that the control of entry into mitosis is fundamentally different in plants versus yeast or metazoans. Our findings build an important base for the understanding and ultimate modulation of plant growth not only during unperturbed but also under harsh environmental conditions."

We provided evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation may trigger the cell death process of the meristematic cells in the stressed root tips. Analysis of BAX inhibitor-1 (AtBI1) expression and the phenotypic response of atbi1-1 mutant under the severe water stress revealed that AtBI1 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway modulate water stress-induced PCD. As a result, the thick and short lateral roots with increased tolerance to the stress are induced. We propose that under severe drought condition, plants activate PCD program in the root apical root meristem, so that apical root dominance is removed. In this way, they can remodel their root system architecture to adapt the stress environment."

 "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are considered to be an important source of genome size variation and genetic and phenotypic plasticity in eukaryotes. Most of our knowledge about TEs comes from large genomic projects and studies focused on model organisms. However, TE dynamics among related taxa from natural populations and the role of TEs at the species or supra-species level, where genome size and karyotype evolution are modulated in concert with polyploidy and chromosomal rearrangements, remain poorly understood. We focused on the holokinetic genus Eleocharis (Cyperaceae), which displays large variation in genome size and the occurrence of polyploidy and agmatoploidy/symploidy. We analyzed and quantified the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy in relation to changes in both genome size and karyotype in Eleocharis. We also examined how this relationship is reflected in the phylogeny of Eleocharis.",

 "text": "Using flow cytometry, we measured the genome sizes of members of the genus Eleocharis (Cyperaceae). We found positive correlation between the independent phylogenetic contrasts of genome size and chromosome number in Eleocharis. We analyzed PCR-amplified sequences of various reverse transcriptases of the LTR retrotransposons Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy (762 sequences in total). Using real-time PCR and dot blot approaches, we quantified the densities of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy within the genomes of the analyzed species. We detected an increasing density of Ty1-copia elements in evolutionarily younger Eleocharis species and found a positive correlation between Ty1-copia densities and C/n-values (an alternative measure of monoploid genome size) in the genus phylogeny. In addition, our analysis of Ty1-copia sequences identified a novel retrotransposon family named Helos1, which is responsible for the increasing density of Ty1-copia. The transition:transversion ratio of Helos1 sequences suggests that Helos1 recently transposed in later-diverging Eleocharis species.",

Additionally, we introduce a new player in the process of genome evolution in holokinetic plants: LTR retrotransposons.",

 "AbstractText": "Temperature is a key environmental factor inducing phenotypic plasticity in a wide range of behavioral, morphological, and life history traits in ectotherms. The strength of temperature-induced responses in fitness-related traits may be determined by plasticity of the underlying physiological or biochemical traits. Lipid composition may be an important trait underlying fitness response to temperature, because it affects membrane fluidity as well as availability of stored energy reserves. Here, we investigate the effect of temperature on lipid composition of the springtail Orchesella cincta by measuring thermal reaction norms across five different temperatures after four weeks of cold or warm acclimation. Fatty acid composition in storage and membrane lipids showed a highly plastic response to temperature, but the responses of single fatty acids revealed deviations from the expectations based on HVA theory. We found an accumulation of C(18:2n6) and C(18:3n3) at higher temperatures and the preservation of C(20:4n6) across temperatures, which is contrary to the expectation of decreased unsaturation at higher temperatures. The thermal response of these fatty acids in O. cincta differed from the findings in other species, and therefore shows there is interspecific variation in how single fatty acids contribute to HVA. Future research should determine the consequences of such variation in terms of costs and benefits for the thermal performance of species.",

 "AbstractText": "Life in extreme environments poses unique challenges to photosynthetic organisms. The ability for an extremophilic green alga and its genetic and mesophilic equivalent to acclimate to changes in their environment was examined to determine the extent of their phenotypic plasticities. The Antarctic extremophile Chlamydomonas raudensis Ettl. UWO 241 (UWO) was isolated from an ice-covered lake in Antarctica, whereas its mesophilic counterpart C. raudensis Ettl. SAG 49.72 (SAG) was isolated from a meadow pool in the Czech Republic. The effects of changes in temperature and salinity on growth, morphology, and photochemistry were examined in the two strains. Differential acclimative responses were observed in UWO which include a wider salinity range for growth, and broader temperature- and salt-induced fluctuations in F(v)/F(m), relative to SAG. Furthermore, the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, measured as 1-q(P), was modulated in the extremophile whereas this was not observed in the mesophile. Interestingly, it is shown for the first time that SAG is similar to UWO in that it is unable to undergo state transitions. The different natural histories of these two strains exert different evolutionary pressures and, consequently, different abilities for acclimation, an important component of phenotypic plasticity. In contrast to SAG, UWO relied on a redox sensing and signalling system under the growth conditions used in this study. It is proposed that growth and adaptation of UWO under a stressful and extreme environment poises this extremophile for better success under changing environmental conditions."

 "AbstractText": "Climate change is altering the availability of resources and the conditions that are crucial to plant performance. One way plants will respond to these changes is through environmentally induced shifts in phenotype (phenotypic plasticity). Understanding plastic responses is crucial for predicting and managing the effects of climate change on native species as well as crop plants. Here, we provide a toolbox with definitions of key theoretical elements and a synthesis of the current understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity relevant to climate change. By bringing ecological, evolutionary, physiological and molecular perspectives together, we hope to provide clear directives for future research and stimulate cross-disciplinary dialogue on the relevance of phenotypic plasticity under climate change.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Herbivory and competition are two of the most common biotic stressors for plants. When occurring simultaneously, responses to one interaction can constrain the induction of responses to the other interaction due to resource limitation and other interactive effects. Thus, to maximize fitness when interacting with competitors and herbivores, plants are likely to express particular combinations of plastic responses. This study reports the interactive effects of herbivory and competition on responses induced in Tithonia tubaeformis plants and describes how natural selection acts on particular plastic responses and on their different combinations. Competition induced a stem elongation response, expressed through an increase in height and mean internode length, together with a decrease in basal diameter. Interestingly, realized resistance increased in both competition and herbivory treatments, suggesting a plastic response in both constitutive and induced resistance traits. Particular combinations of plastic responses defined three plant phenotypes: vigorous, elongated, and resistant plants. The ecological context in which plants grew modified the traits and the particular combinations of plastic responses that were favored by selection. Vigorous plants were favored by selection in all environments, except when they were damaged by herbivores in the absence of neighbors. The combination of responses defining an elongated plant phenotype was favored by selection in crowded conditions. Resistance was negatively selected in the absence of competition and herbivory but favored in the presence of both interactions. In addition, contextual analyses detected that population structure in heterogeneous environments can also influence the outcomes of selection. These findings suggest that natural selection can act on particular combinations of plastic responses, which may allow plants to adjust their phenotypes to those that promote greater fitness under particular ecological conditions."

 "AbstractText": "Oleoresin produced and stored in pine tree leaves provides direct resistance to herbivores, while leaf volatile terpenes (LVT) in the resin are also powerful airborne infochemicals. Resin concentration and profile show considerable spatial and temporal phenotypic variation within and among pine populations. LVT biochemistry is known to be under genetic control, and although LVT should be plastic to diverse abiotic and biotic environmental factors such as nutrient availability and herbivore attack, little is known about their relative contributions and interactive effects. The aim of this paper was to clarify whether reduced phosphorus availability could increase the LVT concentration and affect the expression of herbivore-derived induced defences, and how plasticity would contribute to the phenotypic variation of LVT. The constitutive and methyl-jasmonate (MeJa) induced LVT concentration and profile were analysed in 17 half-sib Pinus pinaster families growing under two levels of P-availability (complete and P-limited fertilization). Individual terpene concentrations showed large additive genetic variation, which was more pronounced in the control than in MeJa-induced pines. MeJa application did not affect the LVT concentration, but significantly modified the LVT profile by depleting the α-pinene content and reducing the sesquiterpene fraction. Low P-availability strongly reduced plant growth and foliar nutrient concentrations, but did not affect LVT concentration and profile, and did not interact with MeJa-induction. Results indicate a strong homeostasis of LVT concentration to P-availability, and minor changes in the LVT profile due to MeJa-induction. Genetic variation appears to be the main source of phenotypic variation affecting the LVT concentration in this pine species."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is an adaptive feature of all organisms, which, in land plants, entails changes in orientation of growth (tropism), patterns of development, organ architecture, timing of developmental processes, and resource allocation. However, little is known about the molecular components that integrate exogenous environmental cues with internal hormonal signaling pathways. This addendum describes a role for calcium-regulated calmodulin-binding transcription 1 (CAMTA1) in auxin signaling and stress responses. We discuss possible mechanisms that may underlie this role of CAMTA1, and speculate on the more general roles of CAMTAs in auxin responses and phenotypic plasticity.",

 "AbstractText": "Ecological systems have naturally high interannual variance in phenology. Component species have presumably evolved to maintain appropriate phenologies under historical climates, but cases of inappropriate phenology can be expected with climate change. Understanding controls on phenology permits predictions of ecological responses to climate change. We studied phenological control systems in Lepidoptera by analyzing flight times recorded at a network of sites in Finland. We evaluated the strength and form of controls from temperature and photoperiod, and tested for geographic variation within species. Temperature controls on phenology were evident in 51% of 112 study species and for a third of those thermal controls appear to be modified by photoperiodic cues. For 24% of the total, photoperiod by itself emerged as the most likely control system. Species with thermal control alone should be most immediately responsive in phenology to climate warming, but variably so depending upon the minimum temperature at which appreciable development occurs and the thermal responsiveness of development rate. Photoperiodic modification of thermal controls constrains phenotypic responses in phenologies to climate change, but can evolve to permit local adaptation. Our results suggest that climate change will alter the phenological structure of the Finnish Lepidoptera community in ways that are predictable with knowledge of the proximate physiological controls. Understanding how phenological controls in Lepidoptera compare to that of their host plants and enemies could permit general inferences regarding climatic effects on mid- to high-latitude ecosystems."

 "AbstractText": "Induced defences are a typical case of phenotypic plasticity, involving benefits for 'plastic' phenotypes under environments with variable degree of stress. Defence induction, in turn, could be energetically expensive incurring costs on growth and reproduction. In this study, we investigated the genetic variation and induction of detoxification enzymes mediated by wheat chemical defences (hydroxamic acids; Hx), and their metabolic and fitness costs using five multilocus genotypes of the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and glutathione S-transferases activities were seen to increase with Hx levels, whereas esterases activity and standard metabolic rate increased in wheat hosts with low Hx levels. Additionally, the intrinsic rate of increase (a fitness proxy) increased in highly defended hosts. However, we did not find significant genetic variation or genotype-host interaction for any studied trait. Therefore, aphids feeding on host plants with elevated chemical defences appeared to reduce their detoxification costs and to increase their reproductive performance, which we interpret as a novel adaptation to defended plants. In brief, this study supports the notion that aphids perform better on highly defended host plants, probably related to the selective pressures during the colonization of New World agroecosystems, characterized by highly defended host plants.",

 "AbstractText": "Global change drivers create new environmental scenarios and selective pressures, affecting plant species in various interacting ways. Plants respond with changes in phenology, physiology, and reproduction, with consequences for biotic interactions and community composition. We review information on phenotypic plasticity, a primary means by which plants cope with global change scenarios, recommending promising approaches for investigating the evolution of plasticity and describing constraints to its evolution. We discuss the important but largely ignored role of phenotypic plasticity in range shifts and review the extensive literature on invasive species as models of evolutionary change in novel environments. Plasticity can play a role both in the short-term response of plant populations to global change as well as in their long-term fate through the maintenance of genetic variation. In new environmental conditions, plasticity of certain functional traits may be beneficial (i.e., the plastic response is accompanied by a fitness advantage) and thus selected for. Plasticity can also be relevant in the establishment and persistence of plants in novel environments that are crucial for populations at the colonizing edge in range shifts induced by climate change. Experimental studies show taxonomically widespread plastic responses to global change drivers in many functional traits, though there is a lack of empirical support for many theoretical models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Future studies should assess the adaptive value and evolutionary potential of plasticity under complex, realistic global change scenarios. Promising tools include resurrection protocols and artificial selection experiments.",

 "AbstractText": "The concept that traits should be associated with related organisms and that nearby populations of the same species are likely to be more similar to each other than to populations spread far apart has long been accepted. Consequently, taxonomic relationships and biogeographical data are commonly believed to have the power to predict the distribution of disease resistance genes among plant species. In this study, we test claims of such predictivity in a group of widely distributed wild potato species. There was no clear association between resistance to soft rot and taxonomic relationships. However, we have found some associations between resistance to soft rot and environmental data such as annual precipitation and annual mean temperature. In addition, we have noted that high levels of resistance are mostly found in species with high levels of phenotypic plasticity. The three most resistant species were Solanum paucijugum, S. brevicaule, and S. commersonii."

For clonal plants, however, phenotypic plasticity may be equally important.

 "text": "The results indicate that at the current stage of spread into New Zealand, the primary adaptive strategy of these three invasive macrophytes is phenotypic plasticity. However, while limited, the possibility that genetic diversity between populations may facilitate ecotypic differentiation in the future cannot be excluded. These results thus indicate that invasive clonal aquatic plants adapt to new introduced areas by phenotypic plasticity. Inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous were important in controlling plant size of E. canadensis and L. major, but no other relationships between plant characteristics and habitat conditions were apparent. This implies that within-species differences in plant size can be explained by local nutrient conditions. All together this strongly suggests that invasive clonal aquatic plants adapt to a wide range of habitats in introduced areas by phenotypic plasticity rather than local adaptation.",

 "AbstractText": "Agrobacterium rhizogenes induces hairy roots through the activity of three essential T-DNA genes, rolA, rolB, and rolC, whereas the orf13 gene acts as an accessory root-inducing gene. rolB, rolC, and orf13 belong to the highly diverged plast gene family with remotely related representatives in the endomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor. Nicotiana glauca and N. tabacum contain A. rhizogenes-derived T-DNAs with active plast genes. Here, we report on the properties of a rolC homolog in N. tabacum, trolC. Dexamethasone-inducible trolC and A4-rolC genes from A. rhizogenes A4 induce comparable, strong growth effects affecting all parts of the plants. Several have not been described earlier and were found to be very similar to the effects of the distantly related plast gene 6b. They include leaf chlorosis and starch accumulation, enations, increase of sucrose-dependent leaf disk expansion, growth of isolated roots on low-sucrose media, and stimulation of sucrose uptake by small root fragments. Collectively, our findings indicate that enhancement of sucrose uptake plays an important role in generating the complex 6b and rolC phenotypes and might be an ancestral property of the plast genes."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity may be critical for nutrient-limited organisms that allocate ingested nutrients to the competing demands of reproduction and survivorship. Leafhoppers that feed on xylem fluid allow assessment of plasticity in response to the constant selective pressure of nutritional inadequacy. We examined feeding behavior (host selection and consumption rates) and nutrient allocation (fecundity, change in body mass and composition) of the xylem fluid-feeding leafhopper Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera:Cicadellidae) on ten genotypes of related Prunus germplasm when adults first seasonally appear, and later during population peaks, to examine the effects of genotypes and season on plasticity of life history and behavioral traits. Behavior and resource allocation to life history traits were both mediated by xylem nutrients, although nutrients impacting behavior differed from those mediating life history. Host selection and consumption varied with genotype between June and July, yet behavior consistently reflected concentrations of dietary glutamine. Resource allocations also increased linearly with nutrient concentrations, but were best correlated to ingested essential amino acids rather than glutamine. Body mass and composition were highly correlated to dietary essential amino acids in June; 6 weeks later, fecundity was instead proportional to essential amino acids. The discrepancy in nutrients which impact behavior versus those mediating life history may explain the weak preference-performance linkage documented for many insects. The demarcation in allocating resources to biomass in June to fecundity in July suggests increased allocation to reproduction during periods of nutrient stress as predicted by the theory of optimal resource allocation; other contributing biotic and abiotic factors are also discussed."

Low ITS sequence variation was found within the monophyletic Alyssum sect. Odontarrhena and especially in A. murale sensu lato.

In Bornmuellera-Leptoplax it represents an early synapomorphy inherited from an ancestor shared with the calcicolous, sister clade of Mediterranean Ptilotrichum. In Alyssum sect. Odontarrhena it has multiple origins even within the three European clades recognized. Lack of geographical cohesion suggests that accumulation ability has been lost or gained over the different serpentine areas of south Europe through independent events of microevolutionary adaptation and selection. Genetic continuity and strong phenotypic plasticity in the A. murale complex call for a reduction of the number of Ni hyperaccumulator taxa formally recognized.",

 "AbstractText": "• Species that exhibit adaptive plasticity alter their phenotypes in response to environmental conditions, thereby maximizing fitness in heterogeneous landscapes. However, under demographic source-sink dynamics, selection should favor traits that enhance fitness in the source habitat at the expense of fitness in the marginal habitat. Consistent with source-sink dynamics, the perennial blueberry, Vaccinium elliottii (Ericaceae), shows substantially higher fitness and population sizes in dry upland forests than in flood-prone bottomland forests, and asymmetrical gene flow occurs from upland populations into bottomland populations. Here, we examined whether this species expresses plasticity to these distinct environments despite source-sink dynamics. • We assessed phenotypic responses to a complex environmental gradient in the field and to water stress in the glasshouse. • Contrary to expectations, V. elliottii exhibited a high degree of plasticity in foliar and root traits (specific leaf area, carbon isotope ratios, foliar nitrogen content, root : shoot ratio, root porosity and root architecture). • We propose that plasticity can be maintained in source-sink systems if it is favored within the source habitat and/or a phylogenetic artifact that is not costly. Additionally, plasticity could be advantageous if habitat-based differences in fitness result from incipient niche expansion. Our results illuminate the importance of evaluating phenotypic traits and fitness components across heterogeneous landscapes.",

 "AbstractText": "• Analysing plant phenotypic plasticity in response to wind is complicated as this factor entails not only mechanical stress but also affects leaf gas and heat exchange. • We exposed Plantago major plants to brushing (mechanical stress, MS) and wind (MS and air flow) and determined the effects on physiological, morphological and mechanical characteristics of leaf petioles and laminas as well as on growth and biomass allocation at the whole-plant level. • Both MS and wind similarly reduced growth but their effects on morphological and mechanical plant traits were different. MS induced the formation of leaves with more slender petioles, and more elliptic and thinner laminas, while wind tended to evoke the opposite response. These morphological and mechanical changes increased lamina and petiole flexibility in MS plants, thus reducing mechanical stress by reconfiguration of plant structure. Responses to wind, on the other hand, seemed to be more associated with reducing transpiration. • These results show that responses to mechanical stress and wind can be different and even in the opposite direction. Plant responses to wind in the field can therefore be variable depending on overall environmental conditions and plant characteristics.",

 "AbstractText": "Adaptive genetic differentiation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity can increase the fitness of plant lineages in heterogeneous environments. We examine the relative importance of genetic differentiation and plasticity in determining the fitness of the annual plant, Erodium cicutarium, in a serpentine grassland in California. Previous work demonstrated that the serpentine sites within this mosaic display stronger dispersal-scale heterogeneity than nonserpentine sites. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment among six sites to characterize selection on plasticity expressed by 180 full-sibling families in response to natural environmental heterogeneity across these sites. Multivariate axes of environmental variation were constructed using a principal components analysis of soil chemistry data collected at every experimental block. Simple linear regressions were used to characterize the intercept, and slope (linear and curvilinear) of reaction norms for each full-sibling family in response to each axis of environmental variation. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed significant selection on trait means and slopes of reaction norms. Multivariate analyses of variance demonstrated genetic differentiation between serpentine and nonserpentine lineages in the expression of plasticity in response to three of the five axes of environmental variation considered. In all but one case, serpentine genotypes expressed a stronger adaptive plastic response than nonserpentine genotypes.",

 "AbstractText": "Climate change affects individual organisms by altering development, physiology, behavior, and fitness, and populations by altering genetic and phenotypic composition, vital rates, and dynamics. We sought to clarify how selection, phenotypic plasticity, and demography are linked in the context of climate change. On the basis of theory and results of recent empirical studies of plants and animals, we believe the ecological and evolutionary issues relevant to population persistence as climate changes are the rate, type, magnitude, and spatial pattern of climate-induced abiotic and biotic change; generation time and life history of the organism; extent and type of phenotypic plasticity; amount and distribution of adaptive genetic variation across space and time; dispersal potential; and size and connectivity of subpopulations. An understanding of limits to plasticity and evolutionary potential across traits, populations, and species and feedbacks between adaptive and demographic responses is lacking. Integrated knowledge of coupled ecological and evolutionary mechanisms will increase understanding of the resilience and probabilities of persistence of populations and species.",

 "AbstractText": "The fields of human behavioral ecology (HBE) and evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) both stand to make significant contributions to our understanding of agricultural origins. These two approaches share a concern with phenotypic-plasticity and its evolutionary significance. HBE considers the adaptive plasticity of the human phenotype in response to resource distribution in time and space and has helped to advance understanding of the economic costs and benefits of food production. However, evo-devo and the associated subject of phenotypic (developmental) plasticity have so far been largely neglected as sources of insight into the domestication of plants, despite growing evidence for their evolutionary importance in nature and their roles in the origins of novel traits. We argue that it is important to consider environmentally induced phenotypic variation resulting directly from both natural- and human-induced ecological change as a source of the distinctive morphologies of domesticated plants."

 "AbstractText": "Light plays a profound role in plant development, yet how photoreceptor excitation directs phenotypic plasticity remains elusive. One of the earliest effects of light is the regulated translocation of the red/far-red photoreceptors, phytochromes, from the cytoplasm to subnuclear foci called phytochrome nuclear bodies. The function of these nuclear bodies is unknown. We report the identification of hemera, a seedling lethal mutant of Arabidopsis with altered phytochrome nuclear body patterns. hemera mutants are impaired in all phytochrome responses examined, including proteolysis of phytochrome A and phytochrome-interacting transcription factors. HEMERA was identified previously as pTAC12, a component of a plastid complex associated with transcription. Here, we show that HEMERA has a function in the nucleus, where it acts specifically in phytochrome signaling, is predicted to be structurally similar to the multiubiquitin-binding protein, RAD23, and can partially rescue yeast rad23mutants. Together, these results implicate phytochrome nuclear bodies as sites of proteolysis."

 "AbstractText": "Black nightshades are a group of species best known for their 'poisonous' or noxious weedy reputation. It is not so well known that species of this group serve as emerging food source in many countries worldwide especially in the African continent. Despite the fact that the section has recently been studied extensively, taxonomy is still unsettled and debated because of inter- and intraspecific hybridization, phenotypic plasticity and polyploidization. In this study we analyze the genetic relationships among diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid species of sect. Solanum, which have possibly taken part in the formation of Solanum nigrum, utilizing multi-locus (SCoT, ISSR) markers combined with chloroplast trnL-F sequence data and morphological characters. We scored 51 morphological characters united with SCoT (171), ISSR (224) and trnL-F (1042), for simultaneous analysis of 49 terminals and 1488 characters. The topology of the tree is concordant with the results of the network analysis. In the phylogenetic networks, all the accessions of the diploid species shared a split with all of the polyploid species. This reflected a high portion of shared ISSR and SCoT bands between diploids and polyploids. In addition, a strong split divided the diploid species. The history of S. nigrum might be reticulate with hybrid speciation playing an important rule. Genetically differentiated diploids in few combinations have created a series of genetically distinct polyploid populations. The insufficient isolation that permitted further recombination between ancient polyploids and diploids have resulted in high level of genotypic and phenotypic polymorphism. This high level of novel genomic variability obviously enabled species to succeed in their new environment."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity plays a key role in modulating how environmental variation influences population dynamics, but we have only rudimentary understanding of how plasticity interacts with the magnitude and predictability of environmental variation to affect population dynamics and persistence. We developed a stochastic individual-based model, in which phenotypes could respond to a temporally fluctuating environmental cue and fitness depended on the match between the phenotype and a randomly fluctuating trait optimum, to assess the absolute fitness and population dynamic consequences of plasticity under different levels of environmental stochasticity and cue reliability. When cue and optimum were tightly correlated, plasticity buffered absolute fitness from environmental variability, and population size remained high and relatively invariant. In contrast, when this correlation weakened and environmental variability was high, strong plasticity reduced population size, and populations with excessively strong plasticity had substantially greater extinction probability. Given that environments might become more variable and unpredictable in the future owing to anthropogenic influences, reaction norms that evolved under historic selective regimes could imperil populations in novel or changing environmental contexts. We suggest that demographic models (e.g. population viability analyses) would benefit from a more explicit consideration of how phenotypic plasticity influences population responses to environmental change."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental change is a common phenomenon, yet is poorly understood at the genetic and molecular level. Aphids exhibit a reproductive plasticity whereby seasonal changes result in asexual or sexual reproduction. To investigate the genetic basis of this reproductive plasticity, we assessed the meiosis and cell cycle gene repertoire in the genome of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Aphids possess meiotic recombination genes and G1-to-S phase transition regulatory genes in gene copy numbers similar to other metazoans. However, mitotic and meiotic regulatory genes have duplicated, and several paralogues exhibit differential expression between reproductive morphs. Together, this suggests that cell cycle plasticity may be important in the evolution and mechanism of aphid reproductive plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Aphids display extraordinary developmental plasticity in response to environmental cues. These differential responses to environmental changes may be due in part to changes in gene expression patterns. To understand the molecular basis for aphid developmental plasticity, we attempted to identify the chromatin-remodelling machinery in the recently sequenced pea aphid genome. We find that the pea aphid possesses a complement of metazoan histone modifying enzymes with greater gene family diversity than that seen in a number of other arthropods. Several genes appear to have undergone recent duplication and divergence, potentially enabling greater combinatorial diversity among the chromatin-remodelling complexes. The abundant aphid chromatin modifying enzymes may facilitate the phenotypic plasticity necessary to maintain the complex life cycle of the aphid."

 "AbstractText": "Self-incompatibility (SI) is thought to have played a key role in the evolution of species as it promotes their outcrossing through the recognition and rejection of self-pollen grains. In most species, SI is under the control of a complex, multiallelic S-locus. The recognition system is associated with quantitative variations of the strength of the SI reaction; the origin of these variations is still not elucidated. To define the genetic regulations involved, we studied the variability of the SI response in homozygous S 15 S 15 plants in cauliflower. These plants were obtained from a self-progeny of a self-compatible (SC) plant heterozygous for S 15, which was generated after five selfing generations from one strongly self-incompatible initial plant. We found a continuous phenotypic variation for SI response in the offspring plants homozygous for the S 15 haplotype, from the strict SI reaction to self-compatibility, with a great proportion of the plants being partially self-compatible (PSC). Decrease in SI levels was also observed during the life of the flower. The number of pollen tubes passing through the stigma barrier was higher when counted 3 or 5 days after pollination than one day after pollination. Analysis of the expression of the two key genes regulating self-pollen recognition in cauliflower, the S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) and S-locus cysteine-rich (SCR/SP11) genes, revealed that self-compatibility or PSC was associated with decreased SRK or SCR/SP11 expression. Our work shows the particularly high level of phenotypic plasticity of the SI response associated with certain S-haplotypes in cauliflower."

 "AbstractText": "One-year-old sun leaves of 60 species of Eucalyptus were collected in August 2005 at an arboretum in South Australia with a mean annual rainfall of 427 mm, and 14 of the same species were sampled at an arboretum in Western Australia with a mean annual rainfall of 216 mm. We determined the genetic and phenotypic variation in carbon isotope composition (delta13C), specific leaf area (SLA) and nitrogen content per unit area of the species at each site. There were very significant (P < 0.001) differences in delta13C among the species at both sites. The mean delta13C of the 60 species at the wetter site was -27.6 per thousand (from -25.8 per thousand in Eucalyptus youngiana to -29.9 per thousand in Eucalyptus salicola) and of the 14 species at the drier site was -25.3 per thousand (from -23.7 per thousand in Eucalyptus ravida to -27.3 per thousand in Eucalyptus ewartiana). Of the 14 species common to both sites, four species had similar values of delta13C at the two sites despite the differences in rainfall, whereas in others the values of delta13C were significantly (P < 0.001) lower (more negative) at the wet than at the dry site. The SLA and nitrogen content per unit leaf area also differed significantly among the species (P < 0.001), but there was not a common relationship between delta13C and SLA or between delta13C and nitrogen content at the two sites. The strong species by environment interaction resulted from some species demonstrating phenotypic plasticity for delta13C, while others were inherently stable across environments."

 "AbstractText": "Specific leaf area (SLA) is an important plant functional trait as it is an indicator of ecophysiological characteristics like relative growth rate, stress tolerance and leaf longevity. Substantial intraspecific variation in SLA is common and usually correlates with environmental conditions. For instance, SLA decreases with increasing altitude, which is understood as adjustment to temperature. It is generally assumed that intraspecific variation is mostly the result of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, but genetic effects may also be present, due to local adaptation or genetic drift. In this study, genotypic and environmental effects on SLA were experimentally separated for the widespread Alpine bell flower Campanula thyrsoides by transplanting plants to three common gardens at contrasting altitudes (600, 1,235 and 1,850 m a.s.l.). Seeds were sampled from 18 populations in four phylogeographic regions within the European Alps. A strong plastic response was observed: SLA decreased with increasing altitude of the common gardens (22.0% of variation). The phylogeographic regions were differentiated in SLA in the common gardens (10.1% of variation), indicating that SLA is at least partly genetically determined. Plants from the six easternmost populations experienced a submediterranean climate and showed decreased SLA values in the three common gardens compared to populations to the west, which may be explained as adaptation to drought. Within these submediterranean populations, SLA decreased with altitude of origin in two out of three common gardens. Concluding, SLA shows strong phenotypic plasticity as well as substantial genetic effects, the latter probably being the result of adaptation to local conditions rather than genetic drift."

 "AbstractText": "Adaptive phenotypic plasticity allows sessile organisms such as plants to match trait expression to the particular environment they experience. Plasticity may be limited, however, by resources in the environment, by responses to prior environmental cues, or by previous interactions with other species, such as competition or herbivory. Thus, understanding the expression of plastic traits and their effects on plant performance requires evaluating trait expression in complex environments, rather than across levels of a single variable. In this study, we tested the independent and combined effects of two components of a plant's environment, herbivory and water availability, on the expression of attractive and defensive traits in Nicotiana quadrivalvis in the greenhouse. Damage and drought did not affect leaf nicotine concentrations but had additive and non-additive effects on floral attractive and defensive traits. Plants in the high water treatment produced larger flowers with more nectar than in the low water treatment. Leaf damage induced greater nectar volumes in the high water treatment only, suggesting that low water limited plastic responses to herbivore damage. Leaf damage also tended to induce higher nicotine concentrations in nectar, consistent with other studies showing that leaf damage can induce floral defenses. Our results suggest that there are separate and synergistic effects of leaf herbivory and drought on floral trait expression, and thus plasticity in response to complex environments may influence plant fitness via effects on floral visitation and defense."

 "AbstractText": "Parietaria judaica (Urticaceae) grows abundantly in urban areas of the Mediterranean region. Its pollen is a major allergy source. We studied the species' distribution and abundance in and around Thessaloniki (Greece), pollen production and pollen season. We also examined how urban pollution affects pollen viability. Our ultimate goal was to obtain an estimate of the species' performance and ability to expand under different environmental conditions related to climate change. We mapped P. judaica and the other Urticaceae species. In a north- and a south-facing population, we recorded the progress of P. judaica flowering and estimated the pollen content per flower, shoot and surface unit. We concurrently assessed atmospheric circulation of Urticaceae pollen. We estimated P. judaica pollen viability and Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in plants collected from sites differing in traffic intensity. P. judaica is the most abundant Urticaceae species in the area; its occurrence has increased dramatically over the last 100 years. Production of flowers is intense in spring and autumn. Flowering started 12 days earlier in the south-facing population in spring, and 3 days later in autumn. Pollen production was higher in spring and in the south-facing population. Flower and pollen production were positively correlated with the size of the plant and the flower, respectively. Copper and lead concentrations in plants were positively correlated with pollen viability, which was higher for plants collected from high-traffic sites. P. judaica has a high phenotypic plasticity; this is a feature that promotes success of expansive and invasive species. It is also well adapted to warm and polluted urban environments. The climatic change forecast for the Mediterranean region could provoke earlier, longer, and more pronounced flowering and, consequently, more P. judaica pollen in the air. In return, this would result in increased severity of Parietaria pollinosis."

 "AbstractText": "The hydrophobic cell wall polymer lignin is deposited in specialized cells to make them impermeable to water and prevent cell collapse as negative pressure or gravitational force is exerted. The variation in lignin subunit composition that exists among different species, and among different tissues within the same species suggests that lignin subunit composition varies depending on its precise function. In order to gain a better understanding of the relationship between lignin subunit composition and the physico-chemical properties of lignified tissues, detailed analyses were performed of near-isogenic brown midrib2 (bm2), bm4, bm2-bm4, and bm1-bm2-bm4 mutants of maize. This investigation was motivated by the fact that the bm2-bm4 double mutant is substantially shorter, displays drought symptoms even when well watered, and will often not develop reproductive organs, whereas the phenotypes of the individual bm single mutants and double mutant combinations other than bm2-bm4 are only subtly different from the wild-type control. Detailed cell wall compositional analyses revealed midrib-specific reductions in Klason lignin content in the bm2, bm4, and bm2-bm4 mutants relative to the wild-type control, with reductions in both guaiacyl (G)- and syringyl (S)-residues. The cellulose content was not different, but the reduction in lignin content was compensated by an increase in hemicellulosic polysaccharides. Linear discriminant analysis performed on the compositional data indicated that the bm2 and bm4 mutations act independently of each other on common cell wall biosynthetic steps. After quantitative analysis of scanning electron micrographs of midrib sections, the variation in chemical composition of the cell walls was shown to be correlated with the thickness of the sclerenchyma cell walls, but not with xylem vessel surface area. The bm2-bm4 double mutant represents the limit of phenotypic plasticity in cell wall composition, as the bm1-bm2-bm4 and bm2-bm3-bm4 mutants did not develop into mature plants, unlike the triple mutants bm1-bm2-bm3 and bm1-bm3-bm4."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity can be a passive response to fluctuating environmental conditions or an active and presumably adaptive (evolved) response selected for in different environments. Here we ask if the larval decision to enter diapause when reared on a host plant associated with a colder habitat is an active or a passive response to host-plant quality or suitability. We compare plasticity in larval propensity to enter diapause of the habitat generalist butterfly Leptidea sinapis and the meadow specialist Leptidea reali in a range of temperatures and long day length on a forest plant, Lathyrus linifolius, and a meadow-associated plant, Lathyrus pratensis. The warmer meadow habitat promotes direct development whereas the colder forest habitat is conducive to diapause. Larvae of L. sinapis had a higher propensity to enter diapause when reared on the forest plant L. linifolius across all temperatures. Conversely, the propensity of L. reali to enter diapause was consistently lower and did not differ between host plants. Larval growth rates were similar between and within butterfly species and between host plants. Hence, we conclude that larval pathway decision-making in L. sinapis is an active response mediated by information from their host plants."

 "AbstractText": "The ability of abscisic acid (ABA) to modulate positive interactions between Arabidopsis thaliana individuals under salinity stress was investigated using abi1-1 (insensitive to ABA), era1-2 (hypersensitive to ABA) mutant and wild type plants. The results showed that sensitivity to ABA affects relative interaction intensity (RII) between Arabidopsis thaliana individuals. The neighbor removal experiments also confirmed the role of phenotypic responses in linking plant-plant interactions and sensitivity to ABA. For abi1-1 mutants, the absolute value differences between neighbor removal and control of stem length, root length, leaf area, leaf thickness, flower density, above biomass/belowground biomass (A/U), photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, leaf water content and water-use efficiency were smaller than those of the wild type, while for era1-2 mutants, these absolute value differences were larger than those of the wild type. Thus, it is suggested that positive interactions between Arabidopsis thaliana individuals are at least partly modulated by different sensitivity to ABA through different physiological and phenotypic plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Plants distributed across a wide range of environmental conditions are submitted to differential selective pressures. Long-term selection can lead to the development of adaptations to the local environment, generating ecotypic differentiation. Additionally, plant species can cope with this environmental variability by phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we examine the importance of both processes in coping with environmental heterogeneity in the Mediterranean sclerophyllous cork oak Quercus suber. For this purpose, we measured growth and key functional traits at the leaf level in 9-year-old plants across 2 years of contrasting precipitation (2005 and 2006) in a common garden. Plants were grown from acorns originated from 13 populations spanning a wide range of climates along the distribution range of the species. The traits measured were: leaf size (LS), specific leaf area (SLA), carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(13)C) and leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (N(mass)). Inter-population differences in LS, SLA and Delta(13)C were found. These differences were associated with rainfall and temperature at the sites of origin, suggesting local adaptation in response to diverging climates. Additionally, SLA and LS exhibited positive responses to the increase in annual rainfall. Year effect explained 28% of the total phenotypic variance in LS and 2.7% in SLA. There was a significant genotype x environment interaction for shoot growth and a phenotypic correlation between the difference in shoot growth among years and the annual mean temperature at origin. This suggests that populations originating from warm sites can benefit more from wet conditions than populations from cool sites. Finally, we investigated the relationships between functional traits and aboveground growth by several regression models. Our results showed that plants with lower SLA presented larger aboveground growth in a dry year and plants with larger leaf sizes displayed larger growth rates in both years. Overall, the study supports the adaptive value of SLA and LS for cork oak under a Mediterranean climate and their potentially important role for dealing with varying temperature and rainfall regimes through both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is an adaptive mechanism adopted by plants in response to environmental heterogeneity. Cultivated and wild species adapt in contrasting environments; however, it is not well understood how genetic changes responsible for phenotypic plasticity were involved in crop evolution. We investigated the genetic control of phenotypic plasticity in Asian cultivated (Oryza sativa) and wild rice (O. rufipogon) under 5 environmental conditions (2 nutrient and 3 density levels). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was conducted for traits affecting plant architecture and biomass production. By analysing the phenotypic means, QTLs of large effects were detected as a cluster on chromosome 7 under all the environmental conditions investigated; this might have contributed to transitions of plant architecture during domestication, as reported previously. Multiple QTLs of plasticity were also found within this QTL cluster, demonstrating that allele-specific environmental sensitivity might control plasticity. Furthermore, QTLs controlling plasticity without affecting phenotypic means were also identified. The mode of action and direction of allele effects of plasticity QTLs varied depending on the traits and environmental signals. These findings confirmed that cultivated and wild rice show distinctive genetic differentiation for phenotypic plasticity, which might have contributed to adaptation under contrasting environmental heterogeneity during the domestication of rice."

Genetic differentiation of quantitative traits among populations has been shown in many species, yet it can also be accompanied by other genetic changes, such as divergence in phenotypic plasticity and in genetic variance. Sideroxylonal (a formylated phloroglucinol compound or FPC) is an important chemical defence in eucalypts. The effect of environmental variation on its production is a critical gap in our understanding of its genetics and evolution.",

Genotype x environment interactions are unlikely to impede evolution or responses to artificial selection on sideroxylonal, but the lack of genetic variation in some populations may be a constraint. The results are broadly consistent with localized selection on foliar defence and illustrate that differentiation in population means, whether due to selection or to drift, can be accompanied by changes in other characteristics, such as plasticity and genetic variance.",

 "AbstractText": "Temporal environmental variation has profound influences on population dynamics and community structure. Examination of functional traits that influence resource uptake and allocation can illuminate how co-occurring species translate environmental variation into different demographic outcomes, yet few studies have considered interspecific differences in trait plasticity. We experimentally manipulated soil moisture to test the hypothesis that differences in morphological plasticity contribute to species differences in demographic response to unpredictable precipitation in Sonoran Desert winter annual plants. We compared plasticity of leaf traits and biomass allocation between Pectocarya recurvata (Boraginaceae) and Stylocline micropoides (Asteraceae), co-occurring species that differ in long-term demographic patterns. The species with highly variable population dynamics, Stylocline, had striking increases in leaf area and root biomass in response to an experimental increase in soil moisture. In contrast, the species with buffered long-term population dynamics, Pectocarya, did not differ in leaf morphology or biomass allocation between soil moisture treatments. Regardless of water treatment, Pectocarya had earlier reproductive phenology and greater fecundity than Stylocline, suggesting that differences in the timing of the phenological transitions from vegetative to reproductive growth may affect species' responses to precipitation pulses. Combining long-term observations with experimental manipulations provides a window into the functional underpinnings and demographic consequences of trait plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Insect herbivory is a major driving force of plant evolution. Phenotypic plasticity and developmental variation provide a means for plants to cope with variable herbivory. We characterized the genetics of developmental variation and phenotypic plasticity in trichome density, a putative defensive trait of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Our results are evaluated in relation to the optimal defense theory, which provides testable predictions for plastic and developmental patterns in defense traits. We found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves, regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on trichome-positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL) by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive, developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome production."

 "AbstractText": "Tree species differences in crown size and shape are often highlighted as key characteristics determining light interception strategies and successional dynamics. The phenotypic plasticity of species in response to light and space availability suggests that intraspecific variability can have potential consequences on light interception and community dynamics. Species crown size varies depending on site characteristics and other factors at the individual level which differ from competition for light and space. These factors, such as individual genetic characteristics, past disturbances or environmental micro-site effects, combine with competition-related phenotypic plasticity to determine the individual variability in crown size. Site and individual variability are typically ignored when considering crown size and light interception by trees, and residual variability is relegated to a residual error term, which is then ignored when studying ecological processes. In the present study, we structured and quantified variability at the species, site, and individual levels for three frequently used tree allometric relations using fixed and random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We focused on two species: Abies alba (silver fir) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) in nine forest stands of the western Alps. We demonstrated that species had different allometric relations from site to site and that individual variability accounted for a large part of the variation in allometric relations. Using a spatially explicit radiation transmission model on real stands, we showed that individual variability in tree allometry had a substantial impact on light resource allocation in the forest. Individual variability in tree allometry modulates species' light-intercepting ability. It generates heterogeneous light conditions under the canopy, with high light micro-habitats that may promote the regeneration of light-demanding species and slow down successional dynamics."

 "text": "In perennial plants (especially post-fire resprouters), extant populations may reflect recruitment events in the distant past. This is true of hybrid zones formed by two Banksia species of swamps and woodlands in south-eastern Australia, Banksia robur and B. oblongifolia. Both resprout after fire but recruitment is dependent on periodic fires. Although plants of intermediate morphology have also been identified as hybrids using allozyme markers, the extent of ongoing hybridization is unknown. This study investigates whether both microsatellite markers and morphological measurements can be used to distinguish between the two species and their hybrids. A recent recruitment event and microsatellite markers allow the frequency of ongoing hybridization to be estimated, and also the effects of environmental variation on the morphology of plants and seedlings to be tested.",

 "AbstractText": "Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in thermally sensitive traits, that is, thermal acclimation, generally increases with increasing latitude and altitude. The presumed explanation is that high-latitude/altitude organisms have evolved greater acclimation ability because of exposure to greater temperature fluctuations. Using a conceptual model of the thermal environment during the reproductive season, we tested this hypothesis against an alternative that plasticity is greater because of increased exposure to specific temperatures that strongly select for thermal acclimation. We examined geographic variation in floral reflectance/color plasticity among 29 European populations of a widespread perennial herb, Plantago lanceolata. Individuals partially thermoregulate reproduction through temperature-sensitive plasticity in floral reflectance/color. Plasticity was positively correlated with latitude and altitude. Path analyses support the hypothesis that the thermal environment mediates these geographic effects. Plasticity declined as seasonal temperature range increased, and it increased as duration of the growing season shortened and as the proportion of time exposed to temperatures favoring thermoregulation increased. Data provide evidence that floral reflectance/color plasticity is adaptive and that it has evolved in response not to the magnitude of temperature variation during the reproductive season but rather to the relative exposure to low temperatures, which favor thermoregulation."

 "AbstractText": "Costs are hypothesized to constrain the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, but they have been difficult to quantify because strong selection should eliminate costly genotypes from natural populations. However, recent studies suggest that crosses between natural populations can recover these genotypes. We determined the adaptive value and costs of, as well as the genetic variation for, physiological and morphological plasticity to soil water limitation in Avena barbata recombinant inbred lines (RILs) created by crossing mesic and xeric ecotypes. All traits were plastic, and plasticity in stomatal limitation of photosynthesis and photosynthetic rate before and at reproduction was adaptive. However, we detected a significant cost of plasticity only for stomatal conductance at reproduction, and the mean cost for all traits of A. barbata RILs was at least 50% smaller than costs previously estimated using RILs. In addition, heritabilities for plasticity were <0.1 and were significant only for photosynthesis at reproduction and leaf mass per unit area. Our results suggest that costs are less likely to constrain the evolution of adaptive plasticity in A. barbata than genetic variation for plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Polyploidy or whole genome duplication (WGD) occurs throughout the evolutionary history of many plants and some animals, including crops such as wheat, cotton, and sugarcane. Recent studies have documented rapid and dynamic changes in genomic structure and gene expression in plant polyploids, which reflects genomic and functional plasticity of duplicate genes and genomes in plants. Common features of uniparental gene regulation and nonadditive gene expression in regulatory pathways responsive to growth, development, and stresses in many polyploids have led to the conclusion that epigenetic mechanisms including chromatin modifications and small RNAs play central roles in shaping molecular and phenotypic novelty that may be selected and domesticated in many polyploid plants and crops."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of one genotype to display different phenotypes under different environmental conditions. Although variation for phenotypic plasticity has been documented in numerous species, little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity. Given their widespread roles in hormonal and environmental signaling, we examined whether genes which encode heterotrimeric G proteins are plasticity genes. We grew multiple alleles of heterotrimeric G-protein mutants, together with wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana, under different watering regimes to determine the contributions of G-protein genes to phenotypic plasticity for a number of developmental and reproduction-related traits. G-protein mutations did not affect significantly the amount of phenotypic variation within an environment for any trait, but did affect significantly the amount of phenotypic plasticity for certain traits. AGB1, which encodes the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein in Arabidopsis, is a plasticity gene and regulates reproductive trait plasticity in response to water availability, resulting in increased fitness (defined as seed production) under drought stress."

 "AbstractText": "High-dispersal rates in heterogeneous environments and historical rapid range expansion can hamper local adaptation; however, we often see clinal variation in high-dispersal tree species. To understand the mechanisms of the species' distribution, we investigated local adaptation and adaptive plasticity in a range-wide context in Sitka spruce, a wind-pollinated tree species that has recently expanded its range after glaciations. Phenotypic traits were observed using growth chamber experiments that mimicked temperature and photoperiodic regimes from the limits of the species realized niche. Bud phenology exhibited parallel reaction norms among populations; however, putatively adaptive plasticity and strong divergent selection were seen in bud burst and bud set timing respectively. Natural selection appears to have favoured genotypes that maximize growth rate during available frost-free periods in each environment. We conclude that Sitka spruce has developed local adaptation and adaptive plasticity throughout its range in response to current climatic conditions despite generally high pollen flow and recent range expansion."

 "AbstractText": "The development of a multicellular organism such as a flowering plant relies on the patterned control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth. Research in the recent years has revealed that the control of cell-cycle progression and growth in plants is distinct from the regulation found in yeast or metazoans. Understanding these plant-specific regulators and networks, in which they act, is key for the understanding of plant development and is of current global importance as a basis for breeding of energy crops as well as the breeding of plants adapted for changing environmental conditions. However, the production of cells and their specification and differentiation overlap in time and space and build an intricate interrelationship of dependencies and feedback loops. In this network, the developmental context and the generation of specific cell types and tissues are often decisive.",

 "AbstractText": "Following the domestication of maize over the past approximately 10,000 years, breeders have exploited the extensive genetic diversity of this species to mold its phenotype to meet human needs. The extent of structural variation, including copy number variation (CNV) and presence/absence variation (PAV), which are thought to contribute to the extraordinary phenotypic diversity and plasticity of this important crop, have not been elucidated. Whole-genome, array-based, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a level of structural diversity between the inbred lines B73 and Mo17 that is unprecedented among higher eukaryotes. A detailed analysis of altered segments of DNA conservatively estimates that there are several hundred CNV sequences among the two genotypes, as well as several thousand PAV sequences that are present in B73 but not Mo17. Haplotype-specific PAVs contain hundreds of single-copy, expressed genes that may contribute to heterosis and to the extraordinary phenotypic diversity of this important crop."

 "AbstractText": "Investigation of responses of meristems to environmental conditions is important for understanding the mechanisms and consequences of plant phenotypic plasticity. Here, we examined how meristem plasticity to light and soil nutrients affected leaf growth and relative growth rate (RGR) in fast- and slow-growing Festuca grass species. Activity in shoot apical meristems was measured by leaf appearance rate, and that in leaf meristems by the duration and rate of cell production, which was further divided into single cell cycle time and the number of dividing cells. Light and soil nutrients affected activity in shoot apical meristems similarly. The high nutrient supply increased the number of dividing cells, which was responsible for enhancement of cell production rate; shaded conditions extended the duration of cell production. As a result, leaf length increased under high nutrient and shaded conditions. The RGR was correlated positively with the total meristem size of the shoot under a low nutrient supply, implying inhibition of RGR by cell production under nutrient-limited conditions. Fast-growing species were more plastic for cell production rate and specific leaf area (SLA) but less plastic for RGR than slow-growing species. This study demonstrates that meristem plasticity plays key roles in characterizing environmental responses of plant species."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The ability to adaptively alter morphological, anatomical, or physiological functional traits to local environmental variations using external environmental cues is especially well expressed by all terrestrial and most aquatic plants. A ubiquitous cue eliciting these plastic phenotypic responses is mechanical perturbation (MP), which can evoke dramatic differences in the size, shape, or mechanical properties of conspecifics. Current thinking posits that MP is part of a very ancient \"stress-perception response system\" that involves receptors located at the cell membrane/cell wall interface capable of responding to a broad spectrum of stress-inducing factors. This hypothesis is explored here from the perspective of cell wall evolution and the control of cell wall architecture by unicellular and multicellular plants. Among the conclusions that emerge from this exploration is the perspective that the plant cell is phenotypically plastic."

 "AbstractText": "Immobile plants and immobile modular animals outlive unitary animals. This paper discusses competing but not necessarily mutually exclusive theories to explain this extreme longevity, especially from the perspective of phenotypic plasticity. Stem cell immortality, vascular autonomy, and epicormic branching are some important features of the phenotypic plasticity of plants that contribute to their longevity. Monocarpy versus polycarpy can also influence the kind of senescent processes experienced by plants. How density-dependent phenomena affecting the establishment of juveniles in these immobile organisms can influence the evolution of senescence, and consequently longevity, is reviewed and discussed. Whether climate change scenarios will favour long-lived or short-lived organisms, with their attendant levels of plasticity, is also presented."

 "AbstractText": "The temperature-size rule, a form of phenotypic plasticity in which decreased temperature increases final size, is one of the most widespread patterns in biology, particularly for ectotherms. Identifying the environmental conditions in which this pattern is reversed is key to understanding the generality of the rule. We use wild and domesticated populations of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta and the natural host plants of this species to explore the consequences of resource quality for the temperature-size rule. Manduca sexta reared on a high-quality host, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), followed the temperature-size rule, with larger final sizes at lower temperatures. In contrast, M. sexta reared on a low-quality host, devil's claw (Proboscidea louisianica), showed the reverse response. Wild and domesticated M. sexta exhibited qualitatively similar responses. Survival, growth and development rates, fecundity, and final size decreased with decreasing temperature in M. sexta reared on devil's claw. We propose that the reversal of the temperature-size rule results from the stressful combination of low temperatures and low dietary quality. Such reversals may impact seasonal and geographic patterns of host use in Manduca and other systems. Our results suggest that the temperature-size rule occurs for a restricted range of nonstressful environmental conditions, limiting the robustness of this widespread pattern of phenotypic plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "By using reciprocal transplant method, Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng. seedlings of five different provenances were reciprocally transplanted into six different sites in Yunnan Province, with the survival rate, plant height, branch number, biomass, flower number per plant, and seed production measured during the period from April 2007 to May 2008. The seedlings growth and reproductive traits of different provenance E. adenophorum all showed strong plasticity to environmental conditions. With increasing latitude and altitude of transplant site, plant height, branch number, biomass, flower number per plant, and seed production of different provenance E. adenophorum decreased, and the differences in these growth and reproductive traits were significant among the transplant sites. However, there were no significant differences in these traits among different provenance E. adenophorum. Provenance and transplant site had no significant interactive effects on the above-mentioned traits except seed production. At each site, the survival rate, growth potential, and reproductive capability of local provenance E. adenophorum didn't have any superiority, illustrating that the success in the invasion of E. adenophorum in Yunnan Province was mainly due to the phenotypic plasticity of the plant, while local adaptability only played lesser important role."

 "AbstractText": "Biotrophic fungal pathogens are expected to have adapted to their host plants for phenological synchrony, to optimize the possibility of contacts leading to infections. We investigated the patterns and causes of variation in phenological synchrony in the oak-powdery mildew pathosystem, a major disease in natural ecosystems. The study was carried out along an altitudinal gradient, representing a wide temperature range, in mature oak stands. Both sporulation (pathogen infective stage) and oak flushing (host susceptible stage) were delayed with increasing elevation, but with a significantly different sensitivity for the two species. This resulted in a variable host-pathogen synchrony along the gradient. A common garden experiment did not give evidence of among-population genetic differentiation (past adaptation) for fungal phenology. This could be explained by the high phenotypic variation in phenology within host populations, precluding selection on fungal phenology at the population scale, but possibly favouring adaptation at the within-population scale. Phenotypic plasticity was the major cause of the observed variation in the phenology of the fungal populations."

 "AbstractText": "Both phenotypic plasticity and genetic determination can be important for understanding how plants respond to environmental change. However, little is known about the plastic response of leaf teeth and leaf dissection to temperature. This gap is critical because these leaf traits are commonly used to reconstruct paleoclimate from fossils, and such studies tacitly assume that traits measured from fossils reflect the environment at the time of their deposition, even during periods of rapid climate change. We measured leaf size and shape in Acer rubrum derived from four seed sources with a broad temperature range and grown for two years in two gardens with contrasting climates (Rhode Island and Florida). Leaves in the Rhode Island garden have more teeth and are more highly dissected than leaves in Florida from the same seed source. Plasticity in these variables accounts for at least 6-19% of the total variance, while genetic differences among ecotypes probably account for at most 69-87%. This study highlights the role of phenotypic plasticity in leaf-climate relationships. We suggest that variables related to tooth count and leaf dissection in A. rubrum can respond quickly to climate change, which increases confidence in paleoclimate methods that use these variables."

 "AbstractText": "While interspecific variation in the temperature response of photosynthesis is well documented, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unknown. Moreover, mechanisms related to species-dependent differences in photosynthetic temperature acclimation are unclear. We compared photosynthetic temperature acclimation in 11 crop species differing in their cold tolerance, which were grown at 15 degrees C or 30 degrees C. Cold-tolerant species exhibited a large decrease in optimum temperature for the photosynthetic rate at 360 microL L(-1) CO(2) concentration [Opt (A(360))] when growth temperature decreased from 30 degrees C to 15 degrees C, whereas cold-sensitive species were less plastic in Opt (A(360)). Analysis using the C(3) photosynthesis model shows that the limiting step of A(360) at the optimum temperature differed between cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive species; ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation rate was limiting in cold-tolerant species, while ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration rate was limiting in cold-sensitive species. Alterations in parameters related to photosynthetic temperature acclimation, including the limiting step of A(360), leaf nitrogen, and Rubisco contents, were more plastic to growth temperature in cold-tolerant species than in cold-sensitive species. These plastic alterations contributed to the noted growth temperature-dependent changes in Opt (A(360)) in cold-tolerant species. Consequently, cold-tolerant species were able to maintain high A(360) at 15 degrees C or 30 degrees C, whereas cold-sensitive species were not. We conclude that differences in the plasticity of photosynthetic parameters with respect to growth temperature were responsible for the noted interspecific differences in photosynthetic temperature acclimation between cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive species."

 "AbstractText": "Determining the sources of floral variation is crucial to the understanding of floral evolution. Architectural effects and phenotypic plasticity in development can play an important role in intraplant floral variation, giving rise to gender dimorphism or sexual specialization. Amphicarpic plants have another source of floral variation that could also be influenced by positional effects. We studied the effects of resource availability and architecture in intraplant floral variability in two ecotypes of the amphicarpic Emex spinosa. Male flowers were smaller than females, irrespective of position or resource availability. Emex spinosa shows gender dimorphism not influenced by positional effects. Flower size differences among positions were mainly due to architecture, because the effects of resources on flower size were minimal. Architectural effects caused a decrease in female flower size from ground to apical positions but an increase in most male traits that resulted in sexual specialization at the end of flowering. In general, the ecotypes were similarly affected by resources or architecture. Differences between subterranean and aerial female flowers seem also to be a consequence of architecture. Our results contribute to the evidence that resource limitation is an overestimated effect and that architectural effects must be considered in studies of floral or fruit variation."

 "AbstractText": "The main goal of this work was to test for plant genetic variation in the phenotypic plasticity response of the weed Ruellia nudiflora to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inoculation. We collected plants in the field, kept them under homogeneous conditions inside a nursery, and then collected seeds from these parent plants to generate five inbred lines (i.e., genetic families). Half of the plants of each inbred line were inoculated with AM fungi while the other half were not (controls); a fully crossed experimental design was then used to test for the effects of treatment (with or without AM fungi inoculation) and inbred line (genetic family). For each plant, we recorded the number of leaves produced and the number of days it survived during a 2-month period. Results showed a strong positive treatment effect (plastic response to AM fungi inoculation) for leaf production and survival. Moreover, in terms of survival, the treatment effect differed between genetic families (significant genetic family by treatment interaction). These findings indicate that the positive effect of AM fungi on plant survival (and potentially also growth) differs across plant genotypes and that such condition may contribute to R. nudiflora's capacity to colonize new environments."

 "AbstractText": "Packaging DNA into chromatin is pivotal for the regulation of genome activity in eukaryotes. This chromatin-level control relies on a range of histone modifications and variants, chromatin-remodeling proteins and DNA methylation in plants and mammals. High-resolution maps have recently been obtained for several chromatin modifications in Arabidopsis, which provide a first glimpse at the organization of plant epigenomes. These maps suggest a pervasive involvement of transcriptional activity in indexing chromatin with reference to the underlying DNA sequence. However, to assess the contribution of chromatin dynamics to plant development and phenotypic plasticity, it will be necessary to shift from a static to a dynamic view of the Arabidopsis epigenome."

 "AbstractText": "The development of shoot-borne roots, or adventitious roots, is indispensable for mass propagation of elite genotypes. It is a complex genetic trait with a high phenotypic plasticity due to multiple endogenous and environmental regulatory factors. We demonstrate here that a subtle balance of activator and repressor AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcripts controls adventitious root initiation. Moreover, microRNA activity appears to be required for fine-tuning of this process. Thus, ARF17, a target of miR160, is a negative regulator, and ARF6 and ARF8, targets of miR167, are positive regulators of adventitious rooting. The three ARFs display overlapping expression domains, interact genetically, and regulate each other's expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by modulating miR160 and miR167 availability. This complex regulatory network includes an unexpected feedback regulation of microRNA homeostasis by direct and nondirect target transcription factors. These results provide evidence of microRNA control of phenotypic variability and are a significant step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating adventitious rooting."

 "AbstractText": "Information on how vegetation adapts to differences in water supply is critical for predicting vegetation survival, growth and water use, which, in turn, has important impacts on site hydrology. Many field studies assess adaptation to water stress by comparing between disparate sites, which makes it difficult to distinguish between physiological or morphological changes and long-term genetic adaptation. When planting trees into new environments, the phenotypic adaptations of a species to water stress will be of primary interest. This study examined the response to water availability of Eucalyptus kochii ssp. borealis (C. Gardner) D. Nicolle, commonly integrated with agriculture in south-western Australia for environmental and economic benefits. By choosing a site where the groundwater depth varied but where climate and soil type were the same, we were able to isolate tree response to water supply. Tree growth, leaf area and stand water use were much larger for trees over shallow groundwater than for trees over a deep water table below a silcrete hardpan. However, water use on a leaf area basis was similar in trees over deep and shallow groundwater, as were the minimum leaf water potential observed over different seasons and the turgor loss point. We conclude that homeostasis in leaf water use and water relations was maintained through a combination of stomatal control and adjustment of sapwood-to-leaf area ratios (Huber value). Differences in the Huber value with groundwater depth were associated with different sapwood-specific conductivity and water use on a sapwood area basis. Knowledge of the coordination between water supply, leaf area, sapwood area and leaf transpiration rate for different species will be important when predicting stand water use."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "At the shoot apex of plants is a small region known as the shoot apical meristem (SAM) that maintains a population of undifferentiated (stem) cells whilst providing cells for developing lateral organs and the stem. All aerial structures of the plant develop from the SAM post-embryogenesis, enabling plants to grow in a characteristic modular fashion with great phenotypic and developmental plasticity throughout their lifetime. The maintenance of the stem cell population is intimately balanced with cell recruitment into differentiating tissues through intercellular communication involving a complex signalling network. Recent studies have shown that diverse regulators function in SAM maintenance, many of which converge on the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene. In this review the diverse regulatory modules that function in SAM maintenance are discussed: transcriptional and epigenetic control, hormonal regulation, and the balance with organogenesis. The central role of WUS as an integrator of multiple signals is highlighted; in addition, accessory feedback loops emerge as a feature enabling dynamic regulation of the stem cell niche."

 "AbstractText": "Response to environmental heterogeneity caused by human activity was analyzed on Iris pumila reciprocal transplants between native steppe and anthropogenic (planted pine forest) habitats that were monitored during several growing seasons in a protected area of Deliblato Sand. Morphometric traits exhibited significant plastic responses to the environmental variability between native and anthropogenic habitats that differed in light quantity and quality, as well as in some other ecological indices. Significant differentiation between populations occupying those habitats was also detected. Plastic responses and population differences were substantially related to the variation in general size and had the same direction, plastic responses being larger in magnitude. Estimates of reproductive and vegetative performance of reciprocal transplants detected home site advantage in the native open but not in the secondary shade habitat created under anthropogenic influence."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Charles Darwin dedicated more than 20 years of his life to a variety of investigations on higher plants (angiosperms). It has been implicitly assumed that these studies in the fields of descriptive botany and experimental plant physiology were carried out to corroborate his principle of descent with modification. However, Darwin's son Francis, who was a professional plant biologist, pointed out that the interests of his father were both of a physiological and an evolutionary nature. In this article, we describe Darwin's work on the physiology of higher plants from a modern perspective, with reference to the following topics: circumnutations, tropisms and the endogenous oscillator model; the evolutionary patterns of auxin action; the root-brain hypothesis; phloem structure and photosynthesis research; endosymbioses and growth-promoting bacteria; photomorphogenesis and phenotypic plasticity; basal metabolic rate, the Pfeffer-Kleiber relationship and metabolic optimality theory with respect to adaptive evolution; and developmental constraints versus functional equivalence in relationship to directional natural selection. Based on a review of these various fields of inquiry, we deduce the existence of a Darwinian (evolutionary) approach to plant physiology and define this emerging scientific discipline as the experimental study and theoretical analysis of the functions of green, sessile organisms from a phylogenetic perspective."

The number of female inflorescences increased after an estimated lag of 24-26 months, corresponding to time from sex differentiation to bunch maturity. The most important adjustment process was increased assimilate storage in the stem, attaining nearly 50 % of dry weight in the stem top, mainly as starch, whereas glucose, which in controls was the most abundant non-structural carbohydrate stored in oil palm, decreased.",

 "AbstractText": "Plant distributions are in part determined by environmental heterogeneity on both large (landscape) and small (several meters) spatial scales. Plant populations can respond to environmental heterogeneity via genetic differentiation between large distinct patches, and via phenotypic plasticity in response to heterogeneity occurring at small scales relative to dispersal distance. As a result, the level of environmental heterogeneity experienced across generations, as determined by seed dispersal distance, may itself be under selection. Selection could act to increase or decrease seed dispersal distance, depending on patterns of heterogeneity in environmental quality with distance from a maternal home site. Serpentine soils, which impose harsh and variable abiotic stress on non-adapted plants, have been partially invaded by Erodium cicutarium in northern California, USA. Using nearby grassland sites characterized as either serpentine or non-serpentine, we collected seeds from dense patches of E. cicutarium on both soil types in spring 2004 and subsequently dispersed those seeds to one of four distances from their maternal home site (0, 0.5, 1, or 10 m). We examined distance-dependent patterns of variation in offspring lifetime fitness, conspecific density, soil availability, soil water content, and aboveground grass and forb biomass. ANOVA revealed a distinct fitness peak when seeds were dispersed 0.5 m from their maternal home site on serpentine patches. In non-serpentine patches, fitness was reduced only for seeds placed back into the maternal home site. Conspecific density was uniformly high within 1 m of a maternal home site on both soils, whereas soil water content and grass biomass were significantly heterogeneous among dispersal distances only on serpentine soils. Structural equation modeling and multigroup analysis revealed significantly stronger direct and indirect effects linking abiotic and biotic variation to offspring performance on serpentine soils than on non-serpentine soils, indicating the potential for soil-specific selection on seed dispersal distance in this invasive species."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Natural genetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana exists for many traits and often reflects acclimation to local environments. Studying natural variation has proven valuable in the characterization of phenotypic traits and, in particular, in identifying genetic factors controlling these traits. It has been previously shown that chromatin compaction changes during development and biotic stress. To gain more insight into the genetic control of chromatin compaction, we investigated the nuclear phenotype of 21 selected Arabidopsis accessions from different geographic origins and habitats. We show natural variation in chromatin compaction and demonstrate a positive correlation with latitude of geographic origin. The level of compaction appeared to be dependent on light intensity. A novel approach, combining Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping and microscopic examination, pointed at PHYTOCHROME-B (PHYB) and HISTONE DEACETYLASE-6 (HDA6) as positive regulators of light-controlled chromatin compaction. Indeed, mutant analyses demonstrate that both factors affect global chromatin organization. HDA6, in addition, strongly promotes the light-mediated compaction of the Nucleolar Organizing Regions (NORs). The accession Cape Verde Islands-0 (Cvi-0), which shows sequence polymorphism in the PHYB gene and in the HDA6 promotor, resembles the hda6 mutant in having reduced chromatin compaction and decreased methylation levels of DNA and histone H3K9 at the NORs. We provide evidence that chromatin organization is controlled by light intensity. We propose that chromatin plasticity is associated with acclimation of Arabidopsis to its environment. The polymorphic alleles such as PHYB and HDA6 control this process."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Recent climate change has caused diverse ecological responses in plants and animals. However, relatively little is known about homeothermic animals' ability to adapt to changing temperature regimes through changes in body size, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. We used fluctuations in mean annual temperatures in south-west Germany since 1972 in order to look for direct links between temperature and two aspects of body size: body mass and flight feather length. Data from regionally born juveniles of 12 passerine bird species were analysed. Body mass and feather length varied significantly among years in eight and nine species, respectively. Typically the inter-annual changes in morphology were complexly non-linear, as was inter-annual variation in temperature. For six (body mass) and seven species (feather length), these inter-annual fluctuations were significantly correlated with temperature fluctuations. However, negative correlations consistent with Bergmann's rule were only found for five species, either for body mass or feather length. In several of the species for which body mass and feather length was significantly associated with temperature, morphological responses were better predicted by temperature data that were smoothed across multiple years than by the actual mean breeding season temperatures of the year of birth. This was found in five species for body mass and three species for feather length. These results suggest that changes in body size may not merely be the result of phenotypic plasticity but may hint at genetically based microevolutionary adaptations."

 "AbstractText": "Stressful parental environments can influence offspring size and development either adaptively or maladaptively, yet little is known about species' differences in this complex aspect of phenotypic plasticity. We performed a reciprocal split-brood experiment to compare transgenerational plasticity in response to drought stress in two closely related annual plant species. We raised inbred replicate parent plants of eight genotypes per species in dry vs. moist soil to generate offspring of each genetic line that differed only in parental environment, then monitored seedling development in both dry and moist conditions. Individuals of the two species expressed contrasting patterns of transgenerational plasticity for traits important to seedling drought tolerance. In Polygonum persicaria, a weedy generalist found in moist, dry, and variably dry sites, drought-stressed plants produced offspring with longer and more rapidly extending root systems and greater biomass when growing in dry soil. In contrast, in P. hydropiper, a non-weedy congener restricted to moist habitats, the offspring of drought-stressed parents had reduced root system development and seedling biomass in dry soil. In P. persicaria, transgenerational and immediate adaptive plasticity combined to produce drought-adapted seedling phenotypes. These results make clear that characteristic patterns of transgenerational plasticity can contribute to ecological diversity among species."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is a perennial, tropical, monocotyledonous plant characterized by simple architecture and low phenotypic plasticity, but marked by long development cycles of individual phytomers (a pair of one leaf and one inflorescence at its axil). Environmental effects on vegetative or reproductive sinks occur with various time lags depending on the process affected, causing source-sink imbalances. This study investigated how the two instantaneous sources of carbon assimilates, CO(2) assimilation and mobilization of transitory non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves, may buffer such imbalances. An experiment was conducted in Indonesia during a 22-month period (from July 2006 to May 2008) at two contrasting locations (Kandista and Batu Mulia) using two treatments (control and complete fruit pruning treatment) in Kandista. Measurements included leaf gas exchange, dynamics of NSC reserves and dynamics of structural aboveground vegetative growth (SVG) and reproductive growth. Drought was estimated from a simulated fraction of transpirable soil water. The main sources of variation in source-sink relationships were (i) short-term reductions in light-saturated leaf CO(2) assimilation rate (A(max)) during seasonal drought periods, particularly in Batu Mulia; (ii) rapid responses of SVG rate to drought; and (iii) marked lag periods between 16 and 29 months of environmental effects on the development of reproductive sinks. The resulting source-sink imbalances were buffered by fluctuations in NSC reserves in the stem, which mainly consisted of glucose and starch. Starch was the main buffer for sink variations, whereas glucose dynamics remained unexplained. Even under strong sink limitation, no negative feedback on A(max) was observed. In conclusion, the different lag periods for environmental effects on assimilate sources and sinks in oil palm are mainly buffered by NSC accumulation in the stem, which can attain 50% (dw:dw) in stem tops. The resulting dynamics of growth and production are complex because several dozen phytomers of different phenological ages develop at any given time and interact with a common pool of reserves."

 "AbstractText": "Woody plants, as sessile and long-lived organisms, are expected to have effective mechanisms for dealing with recurrent environmental stresses. In the present study, we hypothesized that phenotypic plasticity (the ability to express alternative phenotypes) and integration (covariation among functionally related traits) are elicited in plants under stressful wind speed conditions. We investigated the within-crown variation of nine vegetative traits of a tree species (Olea europaea subsp. guanchica) in six populations that represented a gradient of wind speed exposures. Wind-exposed twigs in outer-canopy layers had smaller leaves; thinner, lighter, and shorter internodes; and a larger internode cross-sectional area to leaf area ratio. Comparison between field and greenhouse trials revealed that field differences among populations were mediated by phenotypic plasticity. Outer-canopy twigs expressed plastic responses in populations exposed to high wind speeds, whereas inner-canopy twigs displayed high phenotypic convergence among populations. In addition, phenotypic integration increased with wind exposure (outer canopy > inner canopy > greenhouse) and was consequently affected by canopy openness. We conclude that exposure to wind above a certain speed threshold in this woody species elicits a plastic response that is associated with increased integration among traits and involves mechanical and hydraulic rearrangements in more exposed parts of the trees."

 "AbstractText": "Much attention has been paid to ecology and evolution of damage-induced plant responses. Recently, it has been emphasized that phenotypic plasticity, such as induced plant responses, has the potential to lead to evolutionary changes of interacting partners. Here, we report that induced plant regrowth promotes a locally adaptive feeding preference of a leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora. We found that there was among-population variation in the strength of the feeding preference of the leaf beetle for leaf-age types of conspecific host plants. The strength of the preference was positively correlated to leaf production of host plants across populations, and the intensity of induced regrowth was likely to have been responsible for geographic variation in new leaf production. Within one population, we detected a significant additive genetic variance and heritability in the preference for consuming new vs. old leaves. Moreover, the strength of preference was significantly related to egg production depending on the leaf-age types. Thus, allopatric populations can evolutionarily develop different adaptive preference, according to locally distinct patterns of induced host regrowth."

 "AbstractText": "Plant growth involves the integration of many environmental and endogenous signals that together with the intrinsic genetic program determine plant size. At the cellular level, growth rate is regulated by the combined activity of two processes: cell proliferation and expansion. Gibberellins (GA) are plant-specific hormones that play a central role in the regulation of growth and development with respect to environmental variability. It is well established that GA promote growth through cell expansion by stimulating the destruction of growth-repressing DELLA proteins (DELLAs); however, their effects on cell proliferation remain unknown. Kinematic analysis of leaf and root meristem growth revealed a novel function of DELLAs in restraining cell production. Moreover, by visualizing the cell cycle marker cyclinB1::beta-glucuronidase in GA-signaling mutants, we show that GA modulate cell cycle activity in the root meristem via a DELLA-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, expressing gai (a nondegradable DELLA protein) solely in root meristem reduced substantially the number of dividing cells. We also show that DELLAs restrain cell production by enhancing the levels of the cell cycle inhibitors Kip-related protein 2 (KRP2) and SIAMESE (SIM). Therefore, DELLAs exert a general plant growth inhibitory activity by reducing both cell proliferation and expansion rates, enabling phenotypic plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "Shade avoidance syndrome is a known adaptive response for Impatiens capensis growing in dense intraspecific competition. However, I. capensis also grow with dominant interspecific competitors in marshes. Here, we compare the I. capensis shade-avoidance phenotypes produced in the absence and presence of heterospecific competitors, as well as selection on those traits. Two treatments were established in a marsh; in one treatment all heterospecifics were removed, while in the other, all competitors remained. We compared morphological traits, light parameters, seed output and, using phenotypic selection analysis, examined directional and nonlinear selection operating in the different competitive treatments. Average phenotypes, light parameters and seed production all varied depending on competitive treatment. Phenotypic selection analyses revealed different directional, disruptive, stabilizing and correlational selection. The disparities seen in both phenotypes and selection between the treatments related to the important differences in elongation timing depending on the presence of heterospecifics, although environmental covariances between traits and fitness could also contribute. Phenotypes produced by I. capensis depend on their competitive environment, and differing selection on shade-avoidance traits between competitive environments could indirectly select for increased plasticity given gene flow between populations in different competitive contexts."

 "AbstractText": "Three grasses (Poaceae) of different C(4) subtypes, Paspalum dilatatum (NADP-malic enzyme [ME]), Cynodon dactylon (NAD-ME) and Zoysia japonica (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), occur in natural habitats that differ in annual rainfall. Their leaf characteristics were studied to identify traits related to drought tolerance. Plants were grown in pots, and water deficit was gradually induced by withholding water. Leaves of Z. japonica had the greatest and P. dilatatum the lowest relative dry matter content. Transverse sections of leaves that developed during the water deficit showed little change compared to control leaves, consistent with low phenotypic plasticity. Anatomical features distinguished the three species, with xeromorphic characteristics most strongly represented in Z. japonica. The leaf relative water content (RWC) decreased with the soil water content similarly for the three grasses. However, at 80% RWC, the leaf water potential was -3.1 MPa for Z. japonica and only -1.3 MPa for P. dilatatum and C. dactylon. Soluble amino acids, especially proline, increased as RWC decreased in leaves of C. dactylon and Z. japonica. Phenylalanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine increased more in Z. japonica than in the other two species. The results provide evidence that C. dactylon and, especially, Z. japonica have evolved leaf traits better suited to arid habitats."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Obtaining reliable predictions of species range shifts under climate change is a crucial challenge for ecologists and stakeholders. At the continental scale, niche-based models have been widely used in the last 10 years to predict the potential impacts of climate change on species distributions all over the world, although these models do not include any mechanistic relationships. In contrast, species-specific, process-based predictions remain scarce at the continental scale. This is regrettable because to secure relevant and accurate predictions it is always desirable to compare predictions derived from different kinds of models applied independently to the same set of species and using the same raw data. Here we compare predictions of range shifts under climate change scenarios for 2100 derived from niche-based models with those of a process-based model for 15 North American boreal and temperate tree species. A general pattern emerged from our comparisons: niche-based models tend to predict a stronger level of extinction and a greater proportion of colonization than the process-based model. This result likely arises because niche-based models do not take phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation into account. Nevertheless, as the two kinds of models rely on different assumptions, their complementarity is revealed by common findings. Both modeling approaches highlight a major potential limitation on species tracking their climatic niche because of migration constraints and identify similar zones where species extirpation is likely. Such convergent predictions from models built on very different principles provide a useful way to offset uncertainties at the continental scale. This study shows that the use in concert of both approaches with their own caveats and advantages is crucial to obtain more robust results and that comparisons among models are needed in the near future to gain accuracy regarding predictions of range shifts under climate change."

 "AbstractText": "Histidine-aspartate phosphorelays are employed by two-component signal transduction family proteins to mediate responses to specific signals or stimuli in microorganisms and plants. The RedCDEF proteins constitute a novel signaling system in which four two-component proteins comprising a histidine kinase, a histidine-kinase like protein, and two response regulators function together to regulate progression through the elaborate developmental program of Myxococcus xanthus. A combination of in vivo phenotypic analyses of in-frame deletions and non-functional point mutations in each gene as well as in vitro autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer analyses of recombinant proteins indicate that the RedC histidine kinase protein autophosphorylates and donates a phosphoryl group to the single domain response regulator, RedF, to repress progression through the developmental program. To relieve this developmental repression, RedC instead phosphorylates RedD, a dual receiver response regulator protein. Surprisingly, RedD transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine kinase-like protein RedE, which itself appears to be incapable of autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RedE may render RedE accessible to RedF, where it removes the phosphoryl group from RedF-P, which is otherwise an unusually stable phosphoprotein. These analyses reveal a novel \"four-component\" signaling mechanism that has probably arisen to temporally coordinate signals controlling the developmental program in M. xanthus. The RedCDEF signaling system provides an important example of how the inherent plasticity and modularity of the basic two-component signaling domains comprise a highly adaptable framework well suited to expansion into complex signaling mechanisms."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "This review attempts to present an integrated update of the issue of comparisons of phenotypic plasticity between plants and animals by presenting the problem and its integrated solutions via a whole-organism perspective within an evolutionary framework. Plants and animals differ in two important aspects: mobility and longevity. These features can have important implications for plasticity, and plasticity may even have facilitated greater longevity in plants. Furthermore, somatic genetic mosaicism, intra-organismal selection, and genomic instability contribute to the maintenance of an adaptive phenotype that is especially relevant to long-lived plants. It is contended that a cross-kingdom phylogenetic examination of sensors, messengers and responses that constitute the plasticity repertoire would be more useful than dichotomizing the plant and animal kingdoms. Furthermore, physicochemical factors must be viewed cohesively in the signal reception and transduction pathways leading to plastic responses. Comparison of unitary versus modular organisms could also provide useful insights into the range of expected plastic responses. An integrated approach that combines evolutionary theory and evolutionary history with signal-response mechanisms will yield the most insights into phenotypic plasticity in all its forms."

 "AbstractText": {
 "text": "One of the special properties of clonal plants is the capacity for physiological integration, which can increase plant performance through mechanisms such as resource sharing and co-ordinated phenotypic plasticity when plants grow in microsites with contrasting resource availabilities. However, many clonal plants are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Since AMF are likely to reduce contrasts in effective resource levels, they could also reduce these effects of clonal integration on plasticity and performance in heterogeneous environments.",

"AbstractText": {
 "text": "To test this hypothesis, pairs of connected and disconnected ramets of the stoloniferous herb Trifolium repens were grown. One ramet in a pair was given high light and low nutrients while the other ramet was given high nutrients and low light. The pairs were inoculated with zero, one or five species of AMF.",
".attrs": {
 "Label": "METHODS",
"NlmCategory": "METHODS"

},
"AbstractText": {
 "text": "Pairs of ramets grown without AMF developed division of labour and benefited from resource sharing, as indicated by effects of connection on allocation to roots, accumulation of mass, and ramet production. Inoculation with five species of AMF significantly reduced these effects of connection, both by inhibiting them in ramets given high nutrients and inducing them in ramets given high light. Inoculation with one species of AMF also reduced some effects of connection, but generally to a lesser degree.",

"AbstractText": {
 "text": "The results show that AMF can significantly modify the effects of clonal integration on the plasticity and performance of clonal plants in heterogeneous environments. In particular, AMF may partly replace the effects and benefits of clonal integration in low-nutrient habitats, possibly more so where species richness of AMF is high. This provides the first test of interaction between colonization by AMF and physiological integration in a clonal plant, and a new example of how biotic and abiotic factors could interact to determine the ecological importance of clonal growth.",

 "AbstractText": "Evergreen oaks are an emblematic element of the Mediterranean vegetation and have a leaf phenotype that seems to have remained unchanged since the Miocene. We hypothesise that variation of the sclerophyll phenotype among Iberian populations of Quercus coccifera is partly due to an ulterior process of ecotypic differentiation. We analysed the genetic structure of nine Iberian populations using ISSR fingerprints, and their leaf phenotypes using mean and intracanopy plasticity values of eight morphological (leaf angle, area, spinescence, lobation and specific area) and biochemical traits (VAZ pool, chlorophyll and beta-carotene content). Climate and soil were also characterised at the population sites. Significant genetic and phenotypic differences were found among populations and between NE Iberia and the rest of the populations of the peninsula. Mean phenotypes showed a strong and independent correlation with both genetic and geographic distances. Northeastern plants were smaller, less plastic, with smaller, spinier and thicker leaves, a phenotype consistent with the stressful conditions that prevailed in the steppe environments of the refugia within this geographic area during glaciations. These genetic, phenotypic, geographic and environmental patterns are consistent with previously reported palaeoecological and common evidence. Such consistency leads us to conclude that there has been a Quaternary divergence within the sclerophyllous syndrome that was at least partially driven by ecological factors."

 "AbstractText": "One of the most widely accepted explanations for floral diversification in angiosperms is the pollinator-shift model developed by Verne Grant and Ledyard Stebbins. According to this model, the most profound changes in floral traits (such as morphology, color, patterning and scent) occur when plants undergo adaptive shifts between pollinator classes. We tested this model through investigations of geographical variation in floral form and pollinator assemblages in the South African annual daisy Gorteria diffusa. This species has elaborate insect-like ornaments on the capitulum, which attract bee flies belonging to the genus Megapalpus. We found unprecedented levels of geographically structured intraspecific variation and identified 14 discrete forms that vary in the morphology and ornamentation of the capitulum. This variation is not due to phenotypic plasticity because differences among forms were maintained in plants grown from seed in a common garden experiment. Contrary to predictions from the pollinator-shift model, all populations, regardless of floral phenotype, were pollinated primarily by a single species of Megapalpus bee fly. Much of the extensive variation in floral form in G. diffusa therefore appears to have arisen without evolutionary shifts between pollinator types."

 "AbstractText": "This paper studied the phenotypic plasticity of Agriophyllum squarrosum under effects of soil nutrient and moisture contents and population density. The results showed that with the increase of soil nutrient content, the root/shoot ratio of A. squarrosum was decreased from 0.135 to 0.073. However, soil moisture content and population density had less effect on the root/shoot ratio. The plasticity of reproductive allocation of A. squarrosum as responding to the changes of soil nutrient and moisture contents was a \"real plasticity\", and the allocation was negatively correlated with soil nutrient content but positively correlated with soil moisture content. When soil nutrient content was high or moisture content was low, the reproductive allocation of A. squarrosum changed larger with plant size. Population density had no effects on the reproductive allocation, while plant size conditioned the allocation. Among the three test affecting factors, soil nutrient content had the greatest effects on the morphological characters and biomass of A. squarrosum."

The Bayesian algorithm of the program structure was used to define genetic groups within Hawaiian Metrosideros and the closely related taxon M. collina from the Marquesas and Austral Islands. Several standard and nested AMOVAs were conducted to test whether the genetic diversity is structured geographically or taxonomically.",

 "text": "Heterophyllous aquatic plants show marked phenotypic plasticity. They adapt to environmental changes by producing different leaf types: submerged, floating and terrestrial leaves. By contrast, homophyllous plants produce only submerged leaves and grow entirely underwater. Heterophylly and submerged homophylly evolved under selective pressure modifying the species-specific optima for photosynthesis, but little is known about the evolutionary outcome of habit. Recent evolutionary analyses suggested that rbcL, a chloroplast gene that encodes a catalytic subunit of RuBisCO, evolves under positive selection in most land plant lineages. To examine the adaptive evolutionary process linked to heterophylly or homophylly, we analyzed positive selection in the rbcL sequences of ecologically diverse aquatic plants, Japanese Potamogeton.",

"AbstractText": {
 "text": "Phylogenetic and maximum likelihood analyses of codon substitution models indicated that Potamogeton rbcL has evolved under positive Darwinian selection. The positive selection has operated specifically in heterophyllous lineages but not in homophyllous ones in the branch-site models. This suggests that the selective pressure on this chloroplast gene was higher for heterophyllous lineages than for homophyllous lineages. The replacement of 12 amino acids occurred at structurally important sites in the quaternary structure of RbcL, two of which (residue 225 and 281) were identified as potentially under positive selection.",

 "text": "Our analysis did not show an exact relationship between the amino acid replacements and heterophylly or homophylly but revealed that lineage-specific positive selection acted on the Potamogeton rbcL. The contrasting ecological conditions between heterophyllous and homophyllous plants have imposed different selective pressures on the photosynthetic system. The increased amino acid replacement in RbcL may reflect the continuous fine-tuning of RuBisCO under varying ecological conditions.",

 "AbstractText": "Plants have evolved an elaborate transcriptional machinery dedicated to eliciting sequence-specific, chromatin-based gene silencing. Two Pol II-related, plant-specific RNA polymerases, named Pol IV and Pol V, collaborate with proteins of the RNA interference machinery to generate long and short noncoding RNAs involved in epigenetic regulation. As revealed by a variety of genetic, molecular, and genomic technologies, these RNAs are used extensively in plants to direct the establishment, spread, and removal of DNA cytosine methylation throughout their genomes. RNA-mediated chromatin-level silencing is increasingly implicated in development, stress responses, and natural epigenetic variation that may promote phenotypic diversity, physiological plasticity, and evolutionary change."

 "AbstractText": "Many terrestrial plants form complex morphological structures and will alter these growth patterns in response to light direction. Similarly reef building corals have high morphological variation across coral families, with many species also displaying phenotypic plasticity across environmental gradients. In particular, the colony geometry in branching corals is altered by the frequency, location and direction of branch initiation and growth. This study demonstrates that for the branching species Acropora pulchra, light plays a key role in axial polyp differentiation and therefore axial corallite development--the basis for new branch formation. A. pulchra branches exhibited a directional growth response, with axial corallites only developing when light was available, and towards the incident light. Field experimentation revealed that there was a light intensity threshold of 45 micromol m(-2) s(-1), below which axial corallites would not develop and this response was blue light (408-508 nm) dependent. There was a twofold increase in axial corallite growth above this light intensity threshold and a fourfold increase in axial corallite growth under the blue light treatment. These features of coral branch growth are highly reminiscent of the initiation of phototropic branch growth in terrestrial plants, which is directed by the blue light component of sunlight."

 "AbstractText": "Plant populations of widely distributed species experience a broad range of environmental conditions that can be faced by phenotypic plasticity or ecotypic differentiation and local adaptation. The strategy chosen will determine a population's ability to respond to climate change. To explore this, we grew Quercus ilex (L.) seedlings from acorns collected at six selected populations from climatically contrasting localities and evaluated their response to drought and late season cold events. Maximum photosynthetic rate (A(max)), instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUE), and thermal tolerance to freeze and heat (estimated from chlorophyll fluorescence versus temperature curves) were measured in 5-month-old seedlings in control (no stress), drought (water-stressed), and cold (low suboptimal temperature) conditions. The observed responses were similar for the six populations: drought decreased A(max) and increased iWUE, and cold reduced A(max) and iWUE. All the seedlings maintained photosynthetic activity under adverse conditions (drought and cold), and rapidly increased their iWUE by closing stomata when exposed to drought. Heat and freeze tolerances were similarly high for seedlings from all the populations, and they were significantly increased by drought and cold, respectively; and were positively related to each other. Differences in seedling performance across populations were primarily induced by maternal effects mediated by seed size and to a lesser extent by idiosyncratic physiologic responses to drought and low temperatures. Tolerance to multiple stresses together with the capacity to physiologically acclimate to heat waves and cold snaps may allow Q. ilex to cope with the increasingly stressful conditions imposed by climate change. Lack of evidence of physiologic seedling adaptation to local climate may reflect opposing selection pressures to complex, multidimensional environmental conditions operating within the distribution range of this species."

However, which morphological traits initiate increased self-pollination and which are accumulated after self-fertilization establishes is poorly understood. Because the expression of floral traits may depend on the conditions experienced by an individual during flower development, investigation of changes in mating system should also account for environmental and developmental factors. Here, early stages in the evolution of self-pollination are investigated by comparing floral traits among Brazilian populations of Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae), an annual aquatic that displays variation in selfing rates associated with the breakdown of tristyly to semi-homostyly.",

 "AbstractText": "We investigated the inter-individual variation of phenotypic plasticity and its evolution across three generations within an expanding forest. Plasticity was assessed in situ from dendrochronological data as the response of radial growth to summer rainfall. A linear mixed model was used to account for spatial effects (environment and stand structure), temporal factors (stand dynamics) and the variation with age. Beyond these effects, our results reveal a significant inter-individual variance of growth and plasticity within each generation. We also show that the mean values and variances of growth and plasticity changed significantly across generations, with different patterns for both traits. The possible environmental and genetic drivers of these changes are discussed. Contrasting with the trade-off between stress tolerance and plasticity generally observed among populations, we detected a positive covariance at the individual level, which does not support the cost of plasticity hypothesis in this case."

 "AbstractText": "The nature of plant behaviour is discussed, and it is concluded that it is best described as what plants do. The possibility that plant behaviour is simply signal-induced phenotypic plasticity is outlined, and some limitations of this assumption are considered. Natural environments present many challenges to growing plants, and the consequent signalling that plants perceive is becoming extremely complex. Plant behaviour is active, purposeful and intentional, and examples are discussed. Much plant behaviour, concerned with stress and herbivory, is also based on an assessment of the future likelihood of further damaging episodes and is therefore predictive. Plant behaviour involves the acquisition and processing of information. Informational terminology provides a suitable way of incorporating the concepts of learning, memory and intelligence into plant behaviour, capabilities that plants are rarely credited with. Finally, trade-offs, cost-benefit assessments and decision making are common plant behavioural attributes. It is suggested that intelligent assessments that involve the whole plant are essential to optimize these adaptive capabilities."

 "AbstractText": "The interacting effects of different environmental cues in determining a plant's phenotype and performance are poorly understood aspects of phenotypic plasticity. We examined the interacting effects of shading and mechanical stress (MS) on growth, reproduction, and mechanical stability. We subjected 10 grassland genotypes and 10 forest genotypes of Impatiens capensis to two levels of spectral shading and two levels of MS. Shade induced the production of taller, thinner internodes, but this response was inhibited by MS. This interactive effect was stronger in the grassland genotypes than in the forest genotypes, indicating that shade avoidance can be suppressed by MS and that the degree of this suppression differs between habitats. Among genotypes, greater plasticity in shade-induced internode elongation resulted in a larger reduction in the ability of plants to carry their own weight. This suggests that the occurrence of mechanical constraints may strongly contribute to the selection against shade-induced elongation responses in forest understory genotypes. Our results show that combined responses to different environmental cues can result in a fine-tuning of phenotypic expression by plants by maintaining the potential to strongly respond to single environmental cues but also by preventing potential future costs resulting from poor adaptation to other stresses."

 "AbstractText": "Despite much theoretical discussion on the evolutionary significance of intraclonal genetic variation, particularly for modular organisms whose lack of germ-soma segregation allows for variants arising in clonal growth to contribute to evolutionary change, the potential of this variation to fuel adaptation remains surprisingly untested. Given intraclonal variation, mitotic cell lineages, rather than sexual offspring, may frequently act as units of selection. Here, we applied artificial selection to such lineages in the branching red seaweed Asparagopsis armata, targeting aspects of clonal growth form and growth-form plasticity that enhance light acquisition on patchy subtidal reefs and predicting that a genetic basis to intraclonal variation may promote significant responses that cannot accompany phenotypic variation alone. Cell-lineage selection increased variation in branch proliferation among A. armata genets and successfully altered its plasticity to light. Correlated responses in the plasticity of branch elongation, moreover, showed that cell-lineage selection may be transmitted among the plasticities of growth-form traits in A. armata via pleiotropy. By demonstrating significant responses to cell-lineage selection on growth-form plasticity in this seaweed, our study lends support to the notion that intraclonal genetic variation may potentially help clonal organisms to evolve adaptively in the absence of sex and thereby prove surprisingly resilient to environmental change."

 "text": "Changes in rainfall and temperature brought about through climate change may affect plant species distribution and community composition of grasslands. The primary objective of this study was to test how manipulation of water and temperature would influence the plasticity of stomatal density and leaf area of bluebunch wheatgrass, Pseudoroegneria spicata. It was hypothesized that: (1) an increased water supply will increase biomass and leaf area and decrease stomatal density, while a reduced water supply will cause the opposite effect; (2) an increase in temperature will reduce biomass and leaf area and increase stomatal density; and (3) the combinations of water and temperature treatments can be aligned along a stress gradient and that stomatal density will be highest at high stress. Methods The three water supply treatments were (1) ambient, (2) increased approx. 30% more than ambient through weekly watering and (3) decreased approx. 30 % less than ambient by rain shades. The two temperature treatments were (1) ambient and (2) increased approx. 1-3 degrees C by using open-top chambers. At the end of the second experimental growing season, above-ground biomass was harvested, oven-dried and weighed, tillers from bluebunch wheatgrass plants sampled, and the abaxial stomatal density and leaf area of tillers were measured.",

 "AbstractText": "Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is the most cultivated European pulse crop and the pea seeds mainly serve as a protein source for monogastric animals. Because the seed protein composition impacts on seed nutritional value, we aimed at identifying the determinants of its variability. This paper presents the first pea mature seed proteome reference map, which includes 156 identified proteins (http://www.inra.fr/legumbase/peaseedmap/). This map provides a fine dissection of the pea seed storage protein composition revealing a large diversity of storage proteins resulting both from gene diversity and post-translational processing. It gives new insights into the pea storage protein processing (especially 7S globulins) as a possible adaptation towards progressive mobilization of the proteins during germination. The nonstorage seed proteome revealed the presence of proteins involved in seed defense together with proteins preparing germination. The plasticity of the seed proteome was revealed for seeds produced in three successive years of cultivation, and 30% of the spots were affected by environmental variations. This work pinpoints seed proteins most affected by environment, highlighting new targets to stabilize storage protein composition that should be further analyzed."

 "AbstractText": "The sexual reproductive phase in plants might be particularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming. The direct effect of temperature changes on the reproductive process has been documented previously, and recent data from other physiological processes that are affected by rising temperatures seem to reinforce the susceptibility of the reproductive process to a changing climate. But the reproductive phase also provides the plant with an opportunity to adapt to environmental changes. Understanding phenotypic plasticity and gametophyte selection for prevailing temperatures, along with possible epigenetic changes during this process, could provide new insights into plant evolution under a global-warming scenario."

 "AbstractText": "In many plant species, the alternative respiratory pathway consisting of alternative oxidase (AOX) is affected by growth temperature. The adaptive significance of this temperature-sensitivity is unresolved. Here, leaf and spike (flower cluster) AOX protein content and spike/floral reflectance of genotypes from European Plantago lanceolata populations found in regions differing in reproductive season temperatures were measured. Cloned genotypes grown at controlled warm and cool temperatures were used to assess the natural within- and between-population variation in AOX content, temperature-sensitive phenotypic plasticity in content, and the relationship between AOX and temperature-sensitive floral/spike reflectance. AOX content and plasticity were genetically variable. Leaf AOX content, although greater at cool temperature, was relatively low and not statistically different across populations. Spike AOX content was greater than in leaves. Spike AOX plasticity differed significantly among populations and climate-types and showed significant negative correlation with floral reflectance plasticity, which also varied among populations. Genotypes with more AOX at cool than at warm temperature had greater floral reflectance plasticity; genotypes with relatively more AOX at warm temperature had less floral reflectance plasticity. The data support the hypothesis that plasticity of AOX content in reproductive tissues is associated with long-term thermal acclimatization."

 "AbstractText": "The growth patterns of plants from alpine (sun) and prairie (shade) ecotypes of Stellaria longipes in response to change in light irradiance was investigated and involvement of cytokinins (CKs), auxin (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) was studied to examine the mechanism behind phenotypic plasticity of these plants in response to light signalling. Low light irradiance induced shoot growth in plants of both ecotypes, but IAA levels were higher in plants from alpine, but not prairie ecotype. Dynamics of CK profiles in response to changing photosynthetically active radiation were quite different between ecotypes and changes were more pronounced in the plants of alpine ecotype, where opposite patterns in CK accumulation between low and normal light irradiances were observed. The plants of both ecotypes showed similar trends in ABA levels under low light irradiance. Thus, the highly plastic plants of prairie ecotype may have evolved mechanisms to control the growth in response to reduced light irradiance without major alterations in the levels of CKs or IAA. These results demonstrate that within species, plants from open habitats show less growth response to reduced light irradiance than plants from shaded habitats."

 "AbstractText": "The root system is essential for the growth and development of plants. In addition to anchoring the plant in the ground, it is the site of uptake of water and minerals from the soil. Plant root systems show an astonishing plasticity in their architecture, which allows for optimal exploitation of diverse soil structures and conditions. The signalling pathways that enable plants to sense and respond to changes in soil conditions, in particular nutrient supply, are a topic of intensive research, and root system architecture (RSA) is an important and obvious phenotypic output. At present, the quantitative description of RSA is labour intensive and time consuming, even using the currently available software, and the lack of a fast RSA measuring tool hampers forward and quantitative genetics studies. Here, we describe EZ-Rhizo: a Windows-integrated and semi-automated computer program designed to detect and quantify multiple RSA parameters from plants growing on a solid support medium. The method is non-invasive, enabling the user to follow RSA development over time. We have successfully applied EZ-Rhizo to evaluate natural variation in RSA across 23 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, and have identified new RSA determinants as a basis for future quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis."

 "AbstractText": "Taking four Saussurea species with different ecological breadth in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as test materials, their seedlings relative growth rate (RGR), root mass to shoot mass ratio (R/S), and specific leaf area (SLA) were determined under different nutrient and light treatments. The results showed that nutrient and light had significant effects on the seedlings RGR, R/S and SLA of the four Saussurea species, and there existed a certain interactive effect between nutrient and light. The plasticity of these morphological characteristics and their response patterns to the variation of nutrient and light conditions varied with species. Significant interactive effects (P < 0.001) between light, nutrient, and species were observed on the R/S and SLA of Saussurea. For the four Saussurea species, the mean phenotypic plasticity index of their seedlings was positively correlated with their ecological distribution, being the highest (0.71) for S. japonica, the best widespread species in the four species. The morphological plasticity of Saussurea species was positively related to their distribution ecological breadth."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is the variation in phenotypic traits produced by a genotype in different environments. In contrast, environmental canalization is defined as the insensitivity of a genotype's phenotype to variation in environments. Despite the extensive literature on the evolutionary significance and potential genetic mechanisms driving plasticity and canalization, few studies tried to unravel the genetic basis of this phenomenon. Using both simulations and real data from barley (Hordeum vulgare), we used QTL mapping to obtain insights into the genetics of phenotypic plasticity. We explored two ways of quantifying phenotypic plasticity, namely the phenotypic variance across environments and the Finlay-Wilkinson's regression slope. Each relates to a different concept of stability. Through QTL detection with real and simulated data, we show that each measure of plasticity detects specific types of plasticity QTL. Most of the plasticity QTLs were detected in the data set with the lowest number of environments. All plasticity QTL co-located with loci showing QTL x E interaction and there were no QTL that only affected plasticity. The number of environments that are considered and their homogeneity is a key to interpret the genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. Regulatory pathways of plasticity may vary from one set of environments to another due to unique features of each environment. Therefore, with an increasing number of environments, it may become impossible to detect a single 'consistent' regulatory pathway for all environments."

 "AbstractText": "Plant development is characterized by a profound phenotypic plasticity that often involves redefining of the developmental fate and polarity of cells within differentiated tissues. The plant hormone auxin and its directional intercellular transport play a major role in these processes because they provide positional information and link cell polarity with tissue patterning. This plant-specific mechanism of transport-dependent auxin gradients depends on subcellular dynamics of auxin transport components, in particular on endocytic recycling and polar targeting. Recent insights into these cellular processes in plants have revealed important parallels to yeast and animal systems, including clathrin-dependent endocytosis, retromer function, and transcytosis, but have also emphasized unique features of plant cells such as diversity of polar targeting pathways; integration of environmental signals into subcellular trafficking; and the link between endocytosis, cell polarity, and cell fate specification. We review these advances and focus on the translation of the subcellular dynamics to the regulation of whole-plant development."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "* The transcriptome of an organism is its set of gene transcripts (mRNAs) at a defined spatial and temporal locus. Because gene expression is affected markedly by environmental and developmental perturbations, it is widely assumed that transcriptome divergence among taxa represents adaptive phenotypic selection. This assumption has been challenged by neutral theories which propose that stochastic processes drive transcriptome evolution. * To test for evidence of neutral transcriptome evolution in plants, we quantified 18 494 gene transcripts in nonsenescent leaves of 14 taxa of Brassicaceae using robust cross-species transcriptomics which includes a two-step physical and in silico-based normalization procedure based on DNA similarity among taxa. * Transcriptome divergence correlates positively with evolutionary distance between taxa and with variation in gene expression among samples. Results are similar for pseudogenes and chloroplast genes evolving at different rates. Remarkably, variation in transcript abundance among root-cell samples correlates positively with transcriptome divergence among root tissues and among taxa. * Because neutral processes affect transcriptome evolution in plants, many differences in gene expression among or within taxa may be nonfunctional, reflecting ancestral plasticity and founder effects. Appropriate null models are required when comparing transcriptomes in space and time."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The distinction between white oak species (section Quercus sensu stricto) is largely based on leaf morphological characters. There is, however, considerable within-species variation and no single species-diagnostic character, possibly due to phenotypic plasticity and/or underlying genetic variation. The aim of the present study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the high within-species variation for leaf morphological characters in an F(1) full-sib family derived from a cross between Q. robur and Q. robur ssp. slavonica. In accordance with an earlier QTL mapping study in an intraspecific Q. robur full-sib family, polygenic inheritance was detected for leaf morphological characters that are used to discriminate between the species Quercus robur and Q. petraea. QTLs were distributed over ten linkage groups, showed a moderate effect in terms of phenotypic variance explained (PVE) in the mapping pedigree (3.6-9.6%), but accounted for a considerable amount of the parental differences. Co-localisation of QTLs on the same linkage group in different genetic backgrounds was found for the number and percentage of intercalary veins (NV, PV) on linkage group 3 and for NV on linkage group 5, revealing a high congruence in the relative QTL positions. The generally low correspondence of the other QTLs in the different mapping pedigrees may be an effect of the genetic background and of the environment. In conclusion, leaf morphological characters were found to be under polygenic control, and a comparison to earlier published results led to the identification of two QTLs that were stable across different genetic backgrounds."

 "AbstractText": "Using seasonal cues to time reproduction appropriately is crucial for many organisms. Plants in particular often use photoperiod to signal the time to transition to flowering. Because seasonality varies latitudinally, adaptation to local climate is expected to result in corresponding clines in photoperiod-related traits. By experimentally manipulating photoperiod cues and measuring the flowering responses and photoperiod plasticity of 138 Eurasian accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, we detected strong longitudinal but not latitudinal clines in flowering responses. The presence of longitudinal clines suggests that critical photoperiod cues vary among populations occurring at similar latitudes. Haplotypes at PHYC, a locus hypothesized to play a role in adaptation to light cues, were also longitudinally differentiated. Controlling for neutral population structure revealed that PHYC haplotype influenced flowering time; however, the distribution of PHYC haplotypes occurred in the opposite direction to the phenotypic cline, suggesting that loci other than PHYC are responsible for the longitudinal pattern in photoperiod response. Our results provide previously missing empirical support for the importance of PHYC in mediating photoperiod sensitivity in natural populations of A. thaliana. However, they also suggest that other loci and epistatic interactions likely play a role in the determination of flowering time and that the environmental factors influencing photoperiod in plants vary longitudinally as well as latitudinally."

 "AbstractText": "Green foxtail (Setaria viridis L.) is a common weed species in temperate regions. Research on the effect of delayed reproduction on the phenotypic plasticity and regularity of the vegetative and reproductive growth is of vital significance for understanding population regulation and control of the weed in the growing season. Green foxtail seeds were sown every 10 days from 25 June to 24 August of 2004. The growth and production metrics were measured via harvesting tufts and statistical analysis was carried out. The results showed that the reproductive tillers, seed number, seed biomass and one thousand-seed weight of plants at the first sowing (25 June) approximately increased 28.8, 7 827.0, 1 104.0 and 12.3 times compared with that at the last sowing (24 August), respectively. Total tillers, reproductive tillers and height increased linearly as the reproductive period delayed, however, biomass increased exponentially. Quadratic equations best explained the relationships between the delayed reproductive period and seed number, inflorescence length, one thousand-seed weight, seed biomass. Based on the quantity and quality of seed production, weeding young seedlings emerging before July can be the most effective weed-control strategy in the Songnen Plain."

 "AbstractText": "Our hypothesis is that Lotus glaber (a glycophytic species, highly tolerant to saline-alkaline soils) displays a plastic root phenotypic response to soil salinity that may be influenced by mycorrhizal and rhizobial microorganisms. Uninoculated plants and plants colonised by Glomus intraradices or Mesorhizobium loti were exposed to either 150 or 0 mM NaCl. General plant growth and root architectural parameters (morphology and topology) were measured and phenotypic plasticity determined at the end of the salt treatment period. Two genotypes differing in their salt tolerance capacity were used in this study. G. intraradices and M. loti reduced the total biomass of non-salinised, sensitive plants, but they did not affect that of corresponding tolerant ones. Root morphology of sensitive plants was greatly affected by salinity, whereas mycorrhiza establishment counteracted salinity effects. Under both saline conditions, the external link length and the internal link length of mycorrhizal salt-sensitive plants were higher than those of uninoculated control and rhizobial treatments. The topological trend (TT) was strongly influenced by genotype x symbiosis interaction. Under non-saline conditions, nodulated root systems of the sensitive plant genotype had a more herringbone architecture than corresponding uninoculated ones. At 150 mM NaCl, nodulated root systems of tolerant plants were more dichotomous and those of the corresponding sensitive genotype more herringbone in architecture. Notwithstanding the absence of a link between TTs and variations in plant growth, it is possible to predict a dissimilar adaptation of plants with different TTs. Root colonisation by either symbiotic microorganisms reduced the level of root phenotypic plasticity in the sensitive plant genotype. We conclude that root plasticity could be part of the general mechanism of L. glaber salt tolerance only in the case of non-symbiotic plants."

 "AbstractText": "The seasonal effect is the most significant external source of variation affecting vascular cambial activity and the development of newly divided cells, and hence wood properties. Here, the effect of edapho-climatic conditions on the phenotypic and molecular plasticity of differentiating secondary xylem during a growing season was investigated. Wood-forming tissues of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) were collected from the beginning to the end of the growing season in 2003. Data from examination of fibre morphology, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), analytical pyrolysis, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were combined to characterize the samples. Strong variation was observed in response to changes in edapho-climatic conditions. A genomic approach was used to identify genes differentially expressed during this growing season. Out of 3512 studied genes, 19% showed a significant seasonal effect. These genes were clustered into five distinct groups, the largest two representing genes over-expressed in the early- or late-wood-forming tissues, respectively. The other three clusters were characterized by responses to specific edapho-climatic conditions. This work provides new insights into the plasticity of the molecular machinery involved in wood formation, and reveals candidate genes potentially responsible for the phenotypic differences found between early- and late-wood."

 "AbstractText": "One of the outstanding challenges for evolutionary biologists is to understand how developmental plasticity can influence the evolutionary process. Developmental plasticity frequently involves parental effects, which might enable adaptive and context-dependent transgenerational transmission of phenotypic strategies. However, parent-offspring conflict will frequently result in parental effects that are suboptimal for parents, offspring or both. The fitness consequences of parental effects at evolutionary equilibrium will depend on how conflicts can be resolved by modifications of developmental processes, suggesting that proximate studies of development can inform ultimate questions. Furthermore, recent studies of plants and animals show how studies of parental effects in an ecological context provide important insights into the origin and evolution of adaptation under variable environmental conditions."

 "AbstractText": "Invasive plants may respond through adaptive evolution and/or phenotypic plasticity to new environmental conditions where they are introduced. Although many studies have focused on evolution of invaders particularly in the context of testing the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, few consistent patterns have emerged. Many tests of the EICA hypothesis have been performed in only one environment; such assessments may be misleading if plants that perform one way at a particular site respond differently across sites. Single common garden tests ignore the potential for important contributions of both genetic and environmental factors to affect plant phenotype. Using a widespread invader in North America, Cynoglossum officinale, we established reciprocal common gardens in the native range (Europe) and introduced range (North America) to assess genetically based differences in size, fecundity, flowering phenology and threshold flowering size between native and introduced genotypes as well as the magnitude of plasticity in these traits. In addition, we grew plants at three nutrient levels in a pot experiment in one garden to test for plasticity across a different set of conditions. We did not find significant genetically based differences between native and introduced populations in the traits we measured; in our experiments, introduced populations of C. officinale were larger and more fecund, but only in common garden experiments in the native range. We found substantial population-level plasticity for size, fecundity and date of first flowering, with plants performing better in a garden in Germany than in Montana. Differentiation of native populations in the magnitude of plasticity was much stronger than that of introduced populations, suggesting an important role for founder effects. We did not detect evidence of an evolutionary change in threshold flowering size. Our study demonstrates that detecting genetically based differences in traits may require measuring plant responses to more than one environment."

 "AbstractText": "We tested the hypothesis whether differences between plant populations in root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi could be caused by genetic differentiation between populations. In addition, we investigated whether the response to AM fungi differs between plants from different populations and if it is affected by the soil in which the plants are cultivated. We used Aster amellus, which occurs in fragmented dry grasslands, as a model species and we studied six different populations from two regions, which varied in soil nutrient concentration. We found significant differences in the degree of mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots between regions in the field. To test if these differences were due to phenotypic plasticity or had a genetic basis, we performed a greenhouse experiment. The results suggested that Aster amellus is an obligate mycotrophic plant species with a high dependency upon mycorrhiza. Plant biomass was affected only by soil, and not by population or the interaction between the population and the soil. Mycorrhizal colonization was significantly affected by all three factors (soil, population, interaction of soil and population). Plants from the population originating from the soil with lower nutrient availability developed more mycorrhiza even when grown in soil with higher nutrient availability. The correspondence between mycorrhizal colonization of plants in the field and in both soils in the pot experiment suggests that the observed differences in root colonization have a genetic basis."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is a perennial tropical monocotyledon that produces fruit continuously. The physiological function of the large amounts of sucrose stored in coconut stems is unknown. To test the hypothesis that reserve storage and mobilization enable the crop to adjust to variable sink-source relationships at the scale of the whole plant, we investigated the dynamics of dry matter production, yield and yield components, and concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrate reserves in a coconut plantation on Vanuatu Island in the South Pacific. Two treatments were implemented continuously over 29 months (April 2002 to August 2004): 50% leaf pruning (to reduce the source) and 100% fruit and inflorescence pruning (to reduce the sink). The pruning treatments had little effect on carbohydrate reserves because they affected only petioles, not the main reserve pool in the stem. Both pruning treatments greatly reduced dry matter production of the reproductive compartment, but vegetative growth and development were negligibly affected by treatment and season. Leaf pruning increased radiation-use efficiency (RUE) initially, and fruit pruning greatly reduced RUE throughout the experiment. Changes in RUE were negatively correlated with leaflet soluble sugar concentration, indicating feedback inhibition of photosynthesis. We conclude that vegetative development and growth of coconut show little phenotypic plasticity, assimilate demand for growth being largely independent of a fluctuating assimilate supply. The resulting sink-source imbalances were partly compensated for by transitory reserves and, more importantly, by variable RUE in the short term, and by adjustment of fruit load in the long term. Possible physiological mechanisms are discussed, as well as modeling concepts that may be applied to coconut and similar tree crops."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Signaling through heterotrimeric G-proteins (G-proteins) is a conserved mechanism found in all eukaryotes. In plants, the repertoire of G-protein signaling complex is much simpler than in metazoans. Specifically, the genome of the model plant, Arabidopsis, encodes only one canonical Galpha, one Gbeta, and two Ggamma subunits. Similarly, only one Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) protein is encoded by the Arabidopsis genome, and no bona fide G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) together with its ligand has been unequivocally identified. Nonetheless, several proteins, including AtPIRIN1, PLDa 1, PD1, and THF1, have been shown to physically interact with the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (GPA1), and are potential downstream effectors for GPA1. The smaller repertoire of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex in plants offers a unique advantage over its counterpart in mammals for dissecting their roles in development. The analyses of loss-of-function alleles and gain-of-function transgenic lines of G-protein subunits and signaling components suggest that the G-proteins play regulatory roles in multiple developmental processes ranging from seed germination and early seedling development to root development and organ shape determination. Future studies are expected to reveal more components of the heterotrimeric G-protein signal transduction pathways, and to identify the mechanisms by which G-proteins regulate phenotypic and developmental plasticity."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In the European Alps the increase in air temperature was more than twice the increase in global mean temperature over the last 50 years. The abiotic (glacial) and the biotic components (plants and vegetation) of the mountain environment are showing ample evidence of climate change impacts. In the Alps most small glaciers (80% of total glacial coverage and an important contribution to water resources) could disappear in the next decades. Recently climate change was demonstrated to affect higher levels of ecological systems, with vegetation exhibiting surface area changes, indicating that alpine and nival vegetation may be able to respond in a fast and flexible way in response to 1-2 degrees C warming. We analyzed the glacier evolution (terminus fluctuations, mass balances, surface area variations), local climate, and vegetation succession on the forefield of Sforzellina Glacier (Upper Valtellina, central Italian Alps) over the past three decades. We aimed to quantify the impacts of climate change on coupled biotic and abiotic components of high alpine ecosystems, to verify if an acceleration was occurring on them during the last decade (i.e., 1996-2006) and to assess whether new specific strategies were adopted for plant colonization and development. All the glaciological data indicate that a glacial retreat and shrinkage occurred and was much stronger after 2002 than during the last 35 years. Vegetation started to colonize surfaces deglaciated for only one year, with a rate at least four times greater than that reported in the literature for the establishment of scattered individuals and about two times greater for the well-established discontinuous early-successional community. The colonization strategy changed: the first colonizers are early-successional, scree slopes, and perennial clonal species with high phenotypic plasticity rather than pioneer and snowbed species. This impressive acceleration coincided with only slight local summer warming (approximately -0.5 degree C) and a poorly documented local decrease in the snow cover depth and duration. Are we facing accelerated ecological responses to climatic changes and/or did we go beyond a threshold over which major ecosystem changes may occur in response to even minor climatic variations?"

 "AbstractText": "The aims of this study were to understand the genotypic variability in cell-wall composition and cell-wall accessibility to enzymes in select switchgrass plants obtained from two different populations derived from a base population of octaploid cultivars. Population C+3 was developed by three breeding generations for high digestibility and population C-1 developed by one generation of breeding for low digestibility. Above-ground biomass from 12 selected genotypes, three each with high or low digestibility within each population, was analyzed for their cell-wall aromatics and polysaccharides. The ratio of p-coumaric acid/ferulic acid was greater (P < or = 0.05) for the high-lignin C-1 population over the low-lignin C+3 population, although the amounts of these two phenolics did not differ between populations. Combined values of guaiacyl + syringyl-lignin were consistently higher in genotypes from the C-1 population as compared to the genotypes from the C+3 population. Overall, p-coumaric acid was released by enzymes in greater amounts than ferulic acid in all these genotypes. Genotypes in the C-1 population exhibited lower dry weight loss as compared to the genotypes in the C+3 population after enzymatic digestion, suggesting changes in cell-wall architecture. Overall, our data highlight the phenotypic plasticity coded by the switchgrass genome and suggest that combining dry matter digestibility with other more specific cell-wall traits could result in genotypes with greater utility as bioenergy feedstocks."

 "AbstractText": "Plastic responses of plants exposed to mechanical stress can lead to modified, performance-enhancing, morphologies, sometimes accompanied by costs to reproduction. The capacity to present short-term plastic responses to current stress, the resulting performance (expected lower mechanical forces), and the costs of such responses to reproduction were tested for four aquatic plant species. Two ramets of the same genet were submitted to running vs standing water treatment. Traits describing the morphology, hydrodynamic performance and reproduction (sexual and vegetative) were measured. For one species, plastic responses led to reduced hydrodynamic forces, without apparent costs to reproduction, indicating that the plastic response could be beneficial for plant maintenance in stressful habitats. For two species, plastic responses were not associated with variations in performance and reproduction, possibly because of the low hydrodynamic forces experienced, even for morphologies produced under standing conditions. For one species, plastic responses were associated with a sharp decrease in sexual reproduction, without variations in performance, revealing the negative impact of currents over a short time scale. Species maintenance is linked to the capacity of individuals to tolerate mechanical forces. The contrasting responses to currents may be a key element for predicting community dynamics."

 "AbstractText": "Separate sexes can evolve under nuclear inheritance when unisexuals have more than twice the reproductive fitness of hermaphrodites through one sex function (e.g., when females have more than twice the seed fertility of hermaphrodites). Because separate sexes are thought to evolve most commonly via a gynodioecious intermediate (i.e., populations in which females and hermaphrodites cooccur), the conditions under which females can become established in populations of hermaphrodites are of considerable interest. It has been proposed that resource-poor conditions could promote the establishment of females if hermaphrodites are plastic in their sex allocation and allocate fewer resources to seed production under these conditions. If this occurs, the seed fertility of females could exceed the doubling required for the evolution of unisexuality under low-, but not high-resource conditions (the sex-differential plasticity hypothesis). We tested this hypothesis using replicate experimental arrays of the aquatic herb Sagittaria latifolia grown under two fertilizer treatments. The results supported the sex-differential plasticity hypothesis, with females having more than twice the seed fertility of hermaphrodites under low-, but not high-fertilizer conditions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that separate sexes are more likely to evolve under unfavorable conditions."

 "AbstractText": "Here, an approach based on natural genetic variation was adopted to analyse powdery mildew resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Accessions resistant to multiple powdery mildew species were crossed with the susceptible Col-0 ecotype and inheritance of resistance was analysed. Histochemical staining was used to visualize archetypal plant defence responses such as callose deposition, hydrogen peroxide accumulation and host cell death in a subset of these ecotypes. In six accessions, resistance was likely of polygenic origin while 10 accessions exhibited evidence for a single recessively or semi-dominantly inherited resistance locus. Resistance in the latter accessions was mainly manifested at the terminal stage of the fungal life cycle by a failure of abundant conidiophore production. The resistance locus of several of these ecotypes was mapped to a genomic region containing the previously analysed atypical RPW8 powdery mildew resistance genes. Gene silencing revealed that members of the RPW8 locus were responsible for resistance to Golovinomyces orontii in seven accessions. These results suggest that broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance in A. thaliana is predominantly of polygenic origin or based on RPW8 function. The findings shed new light on the natural variation of inheritance, phenotypic expression and pathogen range of RPW8-conditioned powdery mildew resistance."

 "AbstractText": {
 "text": "Plant growth models able to simulate phenotypic plasticity are increasingly required because (1) they should enable better predictions of the observed variations in crop production, yield and quality, and (2) their parameters are expected to have a more robust genetic basis, with possible implications for selection of quantitative traits such as growth- and allocation-related processes. The structure-function plant model, GREENLAB, simulates resource-dependent plasticity of plant architecture. Evidence for its generality has been previously reported, but always for plants grown in a limited range of environments. This paper aims to test the model concept to its limits by using plant spacing as a means to generate a gradient of competition for light, and by using a new crop species, tomato, known to exhibit a strong photomorphogenetic response.",

 "text": "A greenhouse experiment was carried out with three homogeneous planting densities (plant spacing = 0.3, 0.6 and 1 m). Detailed records of plant development, plant architecture and organ growth were made throughout the growing period. Model calibration was performed for each situation using a statistical optimization procedure (multi-fitting).",

"AbstractText": {
 "text": "Obvious limitations of the present version of the model appeared to account fully for the plant plasticity induced by inter-plant competition for light. A lack of stability was identified for some model parameters at very high planting density. In particular, those parameters characterizing organ sink strengths and governing light interception proved to be environment-dependent. Remarkably, however, responses of the parameter values concerned were consistent with actual growth measurements and with previously reported results. Furthermore, modifications of total biomass production and of allocation patterns induced by the planting-density treatments were accurately simulated using the sets of optimized parameters. These results demonstrate that the overall model structure is potentially able to reproduce the observed plant plasticity and suggest that sound biologically based adaptations could overcome the present model limitations. Potential options for model improvement are proposed, and the possibility of using the kernel algorithm currently available as a fitting tool to build up more sophisticated model versions is advocated.",

 "AbstractText": "Adaptation to different hosts plays a central role in the evolution of specialization and speciation in phytophagous insects and parasites, and our ability to experimentally rank hosts by their quality is critical to research to understand these processes. Here we provide a counter-intuitive example in which growth is faster on poor quality hosts. The leaf beetles Oreina elongata and Oreina cacaliae share their host plant with the rust Uromyces cacaliae. Larvae reared on infected Adenostyles alliariae show reduced growth rate, reduced maximum weight and longer development time. However, they normally respond adaptively to the rust's mid-season arrival. When switched during development from healthy to infected leaves, larvae accelerate growth and reduce development time, but pupate at lower body weight. In this novel plant-insect-fungus interaction, infection forms the cue to trade off life-history traits in order to complete development within the brief alpine summer. It represents a novel mode of developmental plasticity, which is likely to be found in other host-parasite systems whenever host quality deteriorates due to multiple infection or ageing. This phenotypic plasticity would modify competition after co-infection and the mutual selection imposed by hosts and parasites, and creates a paradoxical negative correlation between growth rate and environmental quality."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity allows plants to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Environmental variation among populations may select for differentiation in plasticity. To test this idea, we used the annual plant Geranium carolinianum, which inhabits old fields that are densely vegetated and lack canopy cover and wood margins with tree shade but less neighbor shade. Individuals from three populations of each habitat were planted in natural low and high light environments, and morphological traits important for light acquisition were measured. Old-field plants were more plastic, with greater elongation of petioles and internodes in low light than those from wood margins. This larger shade avoidance response suggests evolution of greater plasticity to neighbor shade than to the tree canopy. Fitness of old-field plants was high across both light environments, whereas fitness of wood-margin plants was reduced in low light. Selection favored longer internodes in low than high light. Finally, plasticity for internode length was negatively associated with fitness in high light, suggesting a cost of plasticity for this trait. Together these results indicate that shade-avoidance plasticity of petiole and internode length is adaptive. However, greater elongation of internode length may be constrained by the cost of plasticity expressed in high light. The evolution of plasticity appears to reflect a balance between its adaptive nature and its cost to fitness."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "As in most insect groups, host plant shifts in cactophilic Drosophila represent environmental challenges as flies must adjust their developmental programme to the presence of different chemical compounds and/or to a microflora that may differ in the diversity and abundance of yeasts and bacteria. In this context, wing morphology provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the factors that may induce changes during development. In this work, we investigated phenotypic plasticity and developmental instability of wing morphology in flies on the cactophilic Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila koepferae raised on alternative breeding substrates. We detected significant differences in wing size between and within species, and between flies reared on different cactus hosts. However, differences in wing shape between flies emerged from different cactus hosts were not significant either in D. buzzatii or in D. koepferae. Our results also showed that morphological responses involved the entire organ, as variation in size and shape correlated between different portions of the wing. Finally, we studied the effect of the rearing cactus host on developmental instability as measured by the degree of fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Levels of FA in wing size were significantly greater in flies of both species reared in non-preferred when compared with those reared in preferred host cacti. Our results are discussed in the framework of an integrative view aimed at investigating the relevance of host plant shifts in the evolution of the guild of cactophilic Drosophila species that diversified in South America."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "How temperate trees respond to drier summers, as predicted by climate change models for parts of Europe and eastern North America, will depend on the drought susceptibility of the root systems. We investigated the importance of the genetic constitution for the belowground drought response of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), in four populations from regions differing in precipitation (520-970 mm year(-1)). Saplings were grown at ample (10 vol.%; well-watered) or reduced (5 vol.%; drought treatment) soil water content in the Göttingen Rhizolab Facility for two consecutive summers, and the responses of fine root biomass, root morphology, root depth distribution, and fine root production and turnover were investigated by a combined mini-rhizotron and harvest technique approach. In the drought treatment, total root mass per plant was reduced by 30-40% as a result of: (1) a reduction in median fine root lifespan by roughly 50% and hence an increase in fine root turnover; and (2) a 10-fold reduction in relative fine root growth rate (productivity per standing root biomass). The root:shoot ratio did not increase with drought. Although beech plants originating from drier climates tended to reduce their root biomass in response to drought less than those from wetter climates, analyses of variance revealed no significant influence of genotype on root mass, morphology, growth rate or turnover. However, most fine root traits showed marked differences between the well-watered and drought treatments. We conclude that beech saplings respond to summer drought primarily by shortening root lifespan, whereas root system structure and root:shoot carbon partitioning pattern are unaltered. Beech fine root growth and turnover exhibited high phenotypic plasticity, but genotypic variation was of minor importance. In contrast, genotype had a strong influence on leaf and shoot morphogenesis and growth."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity in needle morphology with increasing tree size and age was investigated by comparing four age classes of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) ranging from juvenile (3-12 years old) to mature (over 100 years old). With increase in tree age there were significant increases in leaf mass per unit area (LMA), mesophyll and vascular bundle area as a percentage of total needle cross-sectional area, and stomatal density. Within the vascular bundle, both xylem cross-sectional area and tracheid lumen area increased significantly, whereas air space as a percentage of total cross-sectional area decreased. These morphological changes were associated with a significant decrease in photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance, and an increase in (13)C enrichment. Although both photosynthetic capacity and whole-tree conductance decreased significantly between age classes 3 and 12 years, they did not differ between age classes 53 and 127 years, even though needle (13)C enrichment was significantly greater in the 127-year age class. Thus there appear to be compensatory mechanisms that maintain photosynthetic capacity as trees increase in size and vascular complexity, which in red spruce and other species, may affect leaf hydraulic conductance. Although increased LMA may contribute to reduced photosynthetic capacity in red spruce, similar relationships are not seen in other conifers."

 "AbstractText": "Divergence between populations adapting to different environments may be facilitated when the populations differ in their sexual traits. We tested whether colonizing a novel environment may, through phenotypic plasticity, change sexual traits in a way that could alter the dynamics of sexual selection. This hypothesis has two components: changes in mean phenotypes across environments, and changes in the genetic background of the phenotypes that are produced -- or genotype x environment interaction (G x E). We simulated colonization of a novel environment and tested its effect on the mating signals of a member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae), a clade that has diverged in a process involving host plant shifts and signal diversification. We found substantial genetic variation and G x E in most signal traits measured, with little or no change in mean signal phenotypes. We suggest that the expression of extant genetic variation across old and novel environments can initiate signal divergence."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means by which plants cope with environmental heterogeneity. Although ubiquitous in nature, actual phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However, phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value, but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait-mediated interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to global change."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Floral traits are commonly thought to be more canalized than vegetative ones. In addition, floral and vegetative traits are hypothesized to be genetically decoupled, enabling vegetative structures to respond plastically to environmental heterogeneity, and to evolve in response to selection without disrupting the reproductive function of flowers. To test these hypotheses, we evaluate the genetic architecture of floral and vegetative traits in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana raised under variable light-quality environments. Plants were grown either under high or low ratios of red to far-red (R:FR) light, an aspect of light quality that varies with neighbor proximity and regulates competitive shade-avoidance responses. Across environments, we detected significant genetic variation for the average expression of all measured floral traits (petal length and width, stamen length, pistil length, stigma-anther separation, and exsertion of both the stamen and pistil beyond the corolla). Light quality significantly influenced the absolute size of several floral traits as well as the allometry (i.e., relative scaling) of all floral traits, and genotypes differed in the plasticity of floral traits to the light treatments. Exposure to low relative to high R:FR resulted in significantly greater elongation in the vegetative trait, petiole length, and genotypes again differed in the plasticity of this trait to R:FR. Consistent with prior studies, most floral traits were less plastic than the vegetative trait; herkogamy (i.e., stigma-anther separation) was the exception and expressed more variable trait values across environments than petiole length, apparently as a consequence of the independent responses of stamens and pistils. Flowers also showed strong phenotypic integration; genotypic correlations were significantly positive among floral traits within each light treatment. Although floral-vegetative correlations were not significant in the high R:FR light treatment, significant correlations were detected between petal traits, pistil length, and petiole length under low R:FR, in contrast to the widely held hypothesis that floral and vegetative traits are genetically independent. Finally, we detected selection for reduced herkogamy in the low R:FR light treatment. The observed correlation between functional trait groups suggest that vegetative plasticity may affect the expression of floral traits in some environments, and that environment-specific constraints may exist on the evolution of floral and vegetative traits."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation occurs at all levels of organization and across temporal scales within plants. However, the magnitude and functional significance of plasticity is largely unexplored in perennial species. We measured the plasticity of leaf- and shoot-level physiological, morphological and developmental traits in nursery-grown Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. individuals subjected to different nutrient and water availabilities. We also examined the extent to which nutrient and water availability influenced the relationships between these traits and productivity. Populus deltoides responded to changes in resource availability with high plasticity in shoot-level traits and moderate plasticity in leaf-level traits. Although shoot-level traits generally correlated strongly with productivity across fertilization and irrigation treatments, few leaf-level traits correlated with productivity, and the relationships depended on the resource examined. In fertilized plants, leaf nitrogen concentration was negatively correlated with productivity, suggesting that growth, rather than enhanced leaf quality, is an important response to fertilization in this species. With the exception of photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency, traits associated with resource conservation (leaf senescence rate, water-use efficiency and leaf mass per area) were uncorrelated with short-term productivity in nutrient- and water-stressed plants. Our results suggest that plasticity in shoot-level growth traits has a greater impact on plant productivity than does plasticity in leaf-level traits and that the relationships between traits and productivity are highly resource dependent."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Adaptive evolution of phenotypic plasticity requires that plastic genotypes have the highest global fitness. We studied selection by spatial heterogeneity of interspecific competition and flooding, and by temporal heterogeneity of flooding on morphological plasticity of 52 genotypes of the clonal shore plant Ranunculus reptans. Competition reduced clone size, rosette size, leaf length and stolon internode thickness. Flooding had similar effects and reduced competition. Differences in selection between environments imply potential for either local adaptation or for indirect evolution of phenotypic plasticity. We also detected direct selection for plastic reductions in internode length in response to flooding and for a plastic increase in internode length in response to competition. Plastic responses of some morphological traits to flooding were in line with selection thereon, suggesting that they indeed are adaptive and might have evolved in response to direct selection on plasticity."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower) frequently produce glandular trichomes, a trait that may resist herbivory. Constitutive production of trichomes is variable both within and among populations of M. guttatus and most of this variation is genetic. This study demonstrates that damage on early leaves can induce increased trichome production on later leaves, a plastic response that is likely adaptive. Moreover, this study shows that this induction can be maternally transmitted, increasing trichome density in progeny before they experience herbivory. This transgenerational response must involve a yet undescribed epigenetic mechanism. These experiments also show genetic variation among plants in the capacity for both within and between plant generation induction. Despite the clear evolutionary importance of variation in constitutive and induced herbivory-resistance traits, few other studies have noted genetic variation in both within a plant species."

"ArticleTitle": "The evolution of dioecy, heterodichogamy, and labile sex expression in Acer.",
"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "2701-19" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The northern hemisphere tree genus Acer comprises 124 species, most of them monoecious, but 13 dioecious. The monoecious species flower dichogamously, duodichogamously (male, female, male), or in some species heterodichogamously (two morphs that each produce male and female flowers but at reciprocal times). Dioecious species cannot engage in these temporal strategies. Using a phylogeny for 66 species and subspecies obtained from 6600 nucleotides of chloroplast introns, spacers, and a protein-coding gene, we address the hypothesis (Pannell and Verdú, Evolution 60: 660-673. 2006) that dioecy evolved from heterodichogamy. This hypothesis was based on phylogenetic analyses (Gleiser and Verdú, New Phytol. 165: 633-640. 2005) that included 29-39 species of Acer coded for five sexual strategies (duodichogamous monoecy, heterodichogamous androdioecy, heterodichogamous trioecy, dichogamous subdioecy, and dioecy) treated as ordered states or as a single continuous variable. When reviewing the basis for these scorings, we found errors that together with the small taxon sample, cast doubt on the earlier inferences. Based on published studies, we coded 56 species of Acer for four sexual strategies, dioecy, monoecy with dichogamous or duodichogamous flowering, monoecy with heterodichogamous flowering, or labile sex expression, in which individuals reverse their sex allocation depending on environment-phenotype interactions. Using Bayesian character mapping, we infer an average of 15 transformations, a third of them involving changes from monoecy-cum-duodichogamy to dioecy; less frequent were changes from this strategy to heterodichogamy; dioecy rarely reverts to other sexual systems. Contra the earlier inferences, we found no switches between heterodichogamy and dioecy. Unexpectedly, most of the species with labile sex expression are grouped together, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity in Acer may be a heritable sexual strategy. Because of the complex flowering phenologies, however, a concern remains that monoecy in Acer might not always be distinguishable from labile sex expression, which needs to be addressed by long-term monitoring of monoecious trees. The 13 dioecious species occur in phylogenetically disparate clades that date back to the Late Eocene and Oligocene, judging from a fossil-calibrated relaxed molecular clock."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a genotype to express different phenotypes across environments, is an adaptive strategy expected to evolve in heterogeneous environments. One widely held hypothesis is that the evolutionary benefits of plasticity are reduced by its costs, but when compared with the number of traits tested, the evidence for costs is limited. Selection gradients were calculated for traits and trait plasticities to test for costs of plasticity to density in a field study using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Brassica rapa. Significant costs of putatively adaptive plasticity were found in three out of six measured traits. For one trait, petiole length, a cost of plasticity was detected in both environments tested; such global costs are expected to more strongly constrain the evolution of plasticity than local costs expressed in a single environment. These results, in combination with evidence from studies in segregating progenies of Arabidopsis thaliana, suggest that the potential for genetic costs of plasticity exists in natural populations. Detection of costs in previous studies may have been limited because historical selection has purged genotypes with costly plasticity, and experimental conditions often lack environmental stresses."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Here, patterns of phenotypic plasticity and trait integration of leaf characteristics in six geographically discrete populations of the perennial herb Pelargonium australe were compared. It was hypothesized that populations would show local adaptation in trait means, but similar patterns of plasticity and trait integration. Further, it was questioned whether phenotypic plasticity was positively correlated with environmental heterogeneity and whether plasticity for water-use traits in particular was adaptive. Seedlings were grown in a glasshouse at six combinations of water and nutrient availability. Leaf anatomical, morphological and gas exchange traits were measured. High amounts of plasticity in leaf traits were found in response to changes in growth conditions and there was evidence of local adaptation among the populations. While there were significant correlations between plasticity and environmental heterogeneity, not all were positive. Notably, patterns of plasticity and trait integration varied significantly among populations. Despite that variation, some of the observed plasticity was adaptive: fitness was correlated with conservative water use when water was limiting. Pelargonium arrived in Australia approximately 5 million yr ago. It is concluded here that high amounts of plasticity, in some cases adaptive, and weak integration among traits may be key to the spread and success of this species."

 "text": "Prediction of phenotypic traits from new genotypes under untested environmental conditions is crucial to build simulations of breeding strategies to improve target traits. Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization.",

Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model.

A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination.",

 "text": "By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits--such as cob weight--and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GREENLAB maize model. The paper discusses the potentials of GREENLAB to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Here, the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis (GDBH) was tested by quantifying temporal variation in the relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), and phenylpropanoid concentrations of two willow species (Salix sericea and Salix eriocephala) across five fertility levels. Initially, RGR increased and total phenylpropanoids declined (although every individual phenolic did not) as fertility increased, but NAR was unaffected. Subsequently, NAR and phenylpropanoids declined in the low fertility treatment, generating a quadratic response of secondary metabolism across the nutrient gradient. As above- and below-ground growth rates equilibrated, NAR and phenylpropanoids increased in the low fertility treatment, re-establishing a negative linear effect of fertility on secondary metabolism. A transient quadratic response of secondary metabolism is predicted when GDBH is integrated with models of optimal phenotypic plasticity, occurring when low NAR imposes carbon constraints on secondary metabolism in low nutrient environments. Once plants acclimate to nutrient limitation, the equilibrium allocation state is predicted to be a negative correlation between growth and secondary metabolism. Although both willow species generally responded according to GDBH, the complexity observed suggests that prediction of the effects of nutrient availability on secondary metabolism (and other plastic responses) in specific cases requires a priori knowledge of the physiological status of the plant and soil nutrient availability."

 "AbstractText": "Recent studies showed the crucial role of different aspects of phenotypic plasticity when organisms exposed to various environments. Presented study tested integrations among the phenotypic plasticities in fitness, morphological features and host choice behavior of the Aphis fabae genotypes exposed to two different host plants. Results indicated that different aspects of phenotypic plasticities in black bean aphid were not systemically affected by host plant conditions as these features have independent regulation. Host plant conditions affected types of phenotypic plasticities in a different way. However, particularly plasticity in ultimate rostral segment positively integrated with plasticity in fitness on novel host plant."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "How introduced plants, which may be locally adapted to specific climatic conditions in their native range, cope with the new abiotic conditions that they encounter as exotics is not well understood. In particular, it is unclear what role plasticity versus adaptive evolution plays in enabling exotics to persist under new environmental circumstances in the introduced range. We determined the extent to which native and introduced populations of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) are genetically differentiated with respect to leaf-level morphological and physiological traits that allow plants to tolerate different climatic conditions. In common gardens in Washington and Spain, and in a greenhouse, we examined clinal variation in percent leaf nitrogen and carbon, leaf delta(13)C values (as an integrative measure of water use efficiency), specific leaf area (SLA), root and shoot biomass, root/shoot ratio, total leaf area, and leaf area ratio (LAR). As well, we determined whether native European H. perforatum experienced directional selection on leaf-level traits in the introduced range and we compared, across gardens, levels of plasticity in these traits. In field gardens in both Washington and Spain, native populations formed latitudinal clines in percent leaf N. In the greenhouse, native populations formed latitudinal clines in root and shoot biomass and total leaf area, and in the Washington garden only, native populations also exhibited latitudinal clines in percent leaf C and leaf delta(13)C. Traits that failed to show consistent latitudinal clines instead exhibited significant phenotypic plasticity. Introduced St. John's Wort populations also formed significant or marginally significant latitudinal clines in percent leaf N in Washington and Spain, percent leaf C in Washington, and in root biomass and total leaf area in the greenhouse. In the Washington common garden, there was strong directional selection among European populations for higher percent leaf N and leaf delta(13)C, but no selection on any other measured trait. The presence of convergent, genetically based latitudinal clines between native and introduced H. perforatum, together with previously published molecular data, suggest that native and exotic genotypes have independently adapted to a broad-scale variation in climate that varies with latitude."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "1900-11" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Resources, sex ratio, and seed production by hermaphrodites covary among natural populations of many gynodioecious plant species, such that they are functionally \"more dioecious\" as resources become more limiting. Strong correlations among these three factors confound our understanding of their relative roles in maintaining polymorphic sexual systems. We manipulated resource availability and sex ratio and measured their effects on relative fertility and phenotypic selection through the maternal fitness of females and hermaphrodites of Fragaria virginiana. Two results were particularly surprising. First, hermaphrodites showed little variability in fecundity across resource treatments and showed strong positive and context-dependent selection for fruit set. This suggests that variation in hermaphrodite seed production along resource gradients in nature may result from adaptation rather than plasticity. Second, although females increased their fecundity with higher resources, their fertility was unaffected by sex ratio, which is predicted to mediate pollen limitation of females in natural populations where they are common. Selection on petal size of females was also weak, indicating a minimal effect of pollinator attraction on variation in the fertility of female plants. Hence, we found no mechanistic explanation for the complete absence of high-resource high female populations in nature. Despite strong selection for increased fruit set of hermaphrodites, both the strength of selection and its contribution to the maintenance of gynodioecy are severely reduced under conditions where females have high relative fecundity (i.e., low resources and high-female sex ratios). High relative fertility plus high female frequency means that the evolution of phenotypic traits in hermaphrodites (i.e., response to selection via seed function) should be manifested through females because most hermaphrodites will have female mothers. Fruit set was never under strong selection in females; hence, selection to increase fruit set hermaphrodites will be less effective in maintaining their fruiting ability in natural populations with low resources and high female frequency. In sum, both sex ratio and resource availability influence trait evolution indirectly-through their effects on relative fertility of the sexes and patterns of selection. Sex ratio did not impose strong pollen limitation on females but did directly moderate the outcome of natural selection by biasing the maternal sex of the next generation. This direct effect of sex ratio on the manifestation of natural selection is expected to have far greater impact on the evolution of traits, such as seed-producing ability in hermaphrodites and the maintenance of sexual polymorphisms in nature, compared to indirect effects of sex ratio on relative fertility of the sexes."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Natural populations of self-incompatible species often exhibit marked phenotypic variation among individuals in the strength of self-incompatibility (SI). In previous studies, we found that the strength of the SI response in Solanum carolinense, a weedy invasive with RNase-mediated SI, is a plastic trait. Selfing can be particularly important for weeds and other successional species that typically undergo repeated colonization and local extinction events and whose population sizes are often small. We applied a PCR-based protocol to identify the S-alleles present in 16 maternal genotypes and their offspring and performed a two-generation greenhouse study to determine whether variation in the strength of SI is due to the existence of weak and strong S-alleles differing in their ability to recognize and reject self-pollen. We found that allele S9 sets significantly more self seed than the other S-alleles in the population we sampled and that its ability to self is not dependent on interactions with other S-alleles. Our data suggest that the observed variations in self-fertility are likely due to factors that directly influence the expression of SI by altering the translation, turnover, or activity of the S-RNase. The variability in the strength of SI among individuals that we have observed in this and our previous studies raises the possibility that plasticity in the strength of SI in S. carolinense may play a role in the colonization and establishment of this weedy species."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The molecular chaperone HSP90 aids the maturation of a diverse but select set of metastable protein clients, many of which are key to a variety of signal transduction pathways. HSP90 function has been best investigated in animal and fungal systems, where inhibition of the chaperone has exceptionally diverse effects, ranging from reversing oncogenic transformation to preventing the acquisition of drug resistance. Inhibition of HSP90 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana uncovers novel morphologies dependent on normally cryptic genetic variation and increases stochastic variation inherent to developmental processes. The biochemical activity of HSP90 is strictly conserved between animals and plants. However, the substrates and pathways dependent on HSP90 in plants are poorly understood. Progress has been impeded by the necessity of reliance on light-sensitive HSP90 inhibitors due to redundancy in the A. thaliana HSP90 gene family. Here we present phenotypic and genome-wide expression analyses of A. thaliana with constitutively reduced HSP90 levels achieved by RNAi targeting. HSP90 reduction affects a variety of quantitative life-history traits, including flowering time and total seed set, increases morphological diversity, and decreases the developmental stability of repeated characters. Several morphologies are synergistically affected by HSP90 and growth temperature. Genome-wide expression analyses also suggest a central role for HSP90 in the genesis and maintenance of plastic responses. The expression results are substantiated by examination of the response of HSP90-reduced plants to attack by caterpillars of the generalist herbivore Trichoplusia ni. HSP90 reduction potentiates a more robust herbivore defense response. In sum, we propose that HSP90 exerts global effects on the environmental responsiveness of plants to many different stimuli. The comprehensive set of HSP90-reduced lines described here is a vital instrument to further examine the role of HSP90 as a central interface between organism, development, and environment."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In this work we investigate the effect of interspecific hybridization on wing morphology using geometric morphometrics in the cactophilic sibling species D. buzzatii and D. koepferae. Wing morphology in F1 hybrids exhibited an important degree of phenotypic plasticity and differs significantly from both parental species. However, the pattern of morphological variation between hybrids and the parental strains varied between wing size and wing shape, across rearing media, sexes, and crosses, suggesting a complex genetic architecture underlying divergence in wing morphology. Even though there was significant fluctuating asymmetry for both, wing size and shape in F1 hybrids and both parental species, there was no evidence of an increased degree of fluctuating asymmetry in hybrids as compared to parental species. These results are interpreted in terms of developmental stability as a function of a balance between levels of heterozygosity and the disruption of coadaptation as an indirect consequence of genomic divergence."

 "AbstractText": "Puccinellia tenuiflora is a salt-tolerant plant of grass family. By the method of random sampling, big samples of reproductive tillers of P. tenuiflora population on the alkalized meadow in the Songnen Plains of China were collected at early heading, heading, flowering, and milky stages, respectively, and the plasticity of their quantitative characters was analyzed. The results showed that except some fluctuations at flowering stage, the tiller height, tiller biomass, spike length and spike biomass of the reproductive tillers at other three growth stages increased significantly every five days with the increasing time of reproductive growth. At each growth stage, tiller height had a significant positive correlation with spike biomass, but a negative correlation with reproductive allocation. With the time of reproductive growth prolonged, the increasing rate of spike biomass at early heading, flowering and milky stages increased in power function with the increase of tiller height. The reproductive allocation decreased linearly by 43.2% and 44.31% at early heading and heading stages, respectively when the reproductive growth time increased ten days, and by 130% at milky stage when the time increased five days. The regulation of the tiller phenotypic plasticity of P. tenuiflora population at its reproductive growth stage followed definite patterns."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The differences in phenotypic plasticity between invasive (North American) and native (German) provenances of the invasive plant Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) were examined using a multivariate reaction norm approach testing two important attributes of reaction norms described by multivariate vectors of phenotypic change: the magnitude and direction of mean trait differences between environments. Data were collected for six life history traits from native and invasive plants using a split-plot design with experimentally manipulated water and nutrient levels. We found significant differences between native and invasive plants in multivariate phenotypic plasticity for comparisons between low and high water treatments within low nutrient levels, between low and high nutrient levels within high water treatments, and for comparisons that included both a water and nutrient level change. The significant genotype x environment (G x E) effects support the argument that invasiveness of purple loosestrife is closely associated with the interaction of high levels of soil nutrient and flooding water regime. Our results indicate that native and invasive plants take different strategies for growth and reproduction; native plants flowered earlier and allocated more to flower production, while invasive plants exhibited an extended period of vegetative growth before flowering to increase height and allocation to clonal reproduction, which may contribute to increased fitness and invasiveness in subsequent years."

Plasticity in leaf angle, lobation, xanthophyll cycle pigments and beta-carotene content was expressed in sun and shade leaves concurrently and in opposite directions.

Populations of taller plants with larger, thinner (higher specific leaf area) and less spiny leaves exhibited greater plasticity. In these populations, the midday light environment was more uniform at the inner than at the outer canopy layers. Field and common garden data ranked populations in the same order of plasticity.",

 "AbstractText": "Monoecy allows high plasticity in gender expression because the production of separate female and male flowers increases the ability to respond to specific environmental circumstances. We studied variation in sexual expression and its correlates in the monoecious shrub Buxus balearica, for two years, in six populations in the Balearic Islands and four in the Iberian Peninsula. Phenotypic gender varied among populations; while island populations showed slight variations around an average gender, mainland populations showed a broad range of variation in gender among individuals, always biased towards increasing maleness compared with the other populations. Within populations, gender was not related to plant size. Between-year changes were slight and mainly consisted of an increase in relative maleness in the mast year. Reproduction did not affect gender in the next year, as assessed by either observational or experimental methods. Most variation in gender expression occurred among individuals within populations (83.6 %), followed by variation among populations (13.6 %) and years (2.8 %). Our results suggest that male-biased gender at population and plant levels was related to stressful conditions and resource limitation, because: (1) maleness was higher in mainland populations, where summer drought was stronger; (2) maleness increased with elevation; (3) fruit set was positively correlated with femaleness; (4) the percentage of male inflorescences increased over the flowering period; and (5) male inflorescences were preferentially in lower parts of the branch nodes. Higher maleness in mast years, however, could be related to increased male success under synchronic flowering."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Antarctica and its surrounding islands lie at one extreme of global variation in diversity. Typically, these regions are characterized as being species poor and having simple food webs. Here, we show that terrestrial systems in the region are nonetheless characterized by substantial spatial and temporal variations at virtually all of the levels of the genealogical and ecological hierarchies which have been thoroughly investigated. Spatial variation at the individual and population levels has been documented in a variety of genetic studies, and in mosses it appears that UV-B radiation might be responsible for within-clump mutagenesis. At the species level, modern molecular methods have revealed considerable endemism of the Antarctic biota, questioning ideas that small organisms are likely to be ubiquitous and the taxa to which they belong species poor. At the biogeographic level, much of the relatively small ice-free area of Antarctica remains unsurveyed making analyses difficult. Nonetheless, it is clear that a major biogeographic discontinuity separates the Antarctic Peninsula and continental Antarctica, here named the 'Gressitt Line'. Across the Southern Ocean islands, patterns are clearer, and energy availability is an important correlate of indigenous and exotic species richness, while human visitor numbers explain much of the variation in the latter too. Temporal variation at the individual level has much to do with phenotypic plasticity, and considerable life-history and physiological plasticity seems to be a characteristic of Antarctic terrestrial species. Environmental unpredictability is an important driver of this trait and has significantly influenced life histories across the region and probably throughout much of the temperate Southern Hemisphere. Rapid climate change-related alterations in the range and abundance of several Antarctic and sub-Antarctic populations have taken place over the past several decades. In many sub-Antarctic locations, these have been exacerbated by direct and indirect effects of invasive alien species. Interactions between climate change and invasion seem set to become one of the most significant conservation problems in the Antarctic. We conclude that despite the substantial body of work on the terrestrial biodiversity of the Antarctic, investigations of interactions between hierarchical levels remain scarce. Moreover, little of the available information is being integrated into terrestrial conservation planning, which lags far behind in this region by comparison with most others."

 "AbstractText": "Genetic variability of Athyrium filix-femina populations was evaluated with regard to phenotypic, allozyme, and RAPD variation in 20 Swiss populations along five altitudinal gradients at four different elevations in the northern Swiss Alps. Additionally, allozyme and phenotypic variations in one Italian and two Spanish populations were compared with the variation in the Swiss populations. We hypothesized that there will be statistically significant genetic differences among populations of different altitudes and sites. The results showed no substantial correlation between genetic variation and phenotypic variation among Swiss populations. These results imply that outbreeding and effective gene exchange (long-distance spore dispersal) are the keys to population structure in this fern species, and as a consequence, phenotypic plasticity is assumed to be favored. This contrasts with results found in similar studies of herbaceous flowering plants where genetic adaptation to gradients like altitude is common. However, when data from the more distant Italian and Spanish populations of A. filix-femina were included, significant variation was detected."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Most studies of phenotypic plasticity investigate the effects of an individual environmental factor on organism phenotypes. However, organisms exist in an ecologically complex world where multiple environmental factors can interact to affect growth, development and life histories. Here, using a multifactorial experimental design, we examine the separate and interactive effects of two environmental factors, rearing host species (Vigna radiata, Vigna angularis and Vigna unguiculata) and temperature (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), on growth and life history traits in two populations [Burkina Faso (BF) and South India (SI)] of the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. The two study populations of beetles responded differently to both rearing host and temperature. We also found a significant interaction between rearing host and temperature for body size, growth rate and female lifetime fecundity but not larval development time or larval survivorship. The interaction was most apparent for growth rate; the variance in growth rate among hosts increased with increasing temperature. However, the details of host differences differed between our two study populations; the degree to which V. unguiculata was a better host than V. angularis or V. radiata increased at higher temperatures for BF beetles, whereas the degree to which V. unguiculata was the worst host increased at higher temperatures for SI beetles. We also found that the heritabilities of body mass, growth rate and fecundity were similar among rearing hosts and temperatures, and that the cross-temperature genetic correlation was not affected by rearing host, suggesting that genetic architecture is generally stable across rearing conditions. The most important finding of our study is that multiple environmental factors can interact to affect organism growth, but the degree of interaction, and thus the degree of complexity of phenotypic plasticity, varies among traits and between populations."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "273-80" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Sexual size dimorphism is widespread in animals but varies considerably among species and among populations within species. Much of this variation is assumed to be due to variance in selection on males versus females. However, environmental variables could affect the development of females and males differently, generating variation in dimorphism. Here we use a factorial experimental design to simultaneously examine the effects of rearing host and temperature on sexual dimorphism of the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. We found that the sexes differed in phenotypic plasticity of body size in response to rearing temperature but not rearing host, creating substantial temperature-induced variation in sexual dimorphism; females were larger than males at all temperatures, but the degree of this dimorphism was smallest at the lowest temperature. This change in dimorphism was due to a gender difference in the effect of temperature on growth rate and not due to sexual differences in plasticity of development time. Furthermore, the sex ratio (proportion males) decreased with decreasing temperature and became female-biased at the lowest temperature. This suggests that the temperature-induced change in dimorphism is potentially due to a change in non-random larval mortality of males versus females. This most important implication of this study is that rearing temperature can generate considerable intraspecific variation in the degree of sexual size dimorphism, though most studies assume that dimorphism varies little within species. Future studies should focus on whether sexual differences in phenotypic plasticity of body size are a consequence of adaptive canalization of one sex against environmental variation in temperature or whether they simply reflect a consequence of non-adaptive developmental differences between males and females."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Invasiveness may result from genetic variation and adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, and genetic variation in fitness traits may be especially critical. Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass, Poaceae) is highly invasive in Hawaii (HI), moderately invasive in Arizona (AZ), and less invasive in southern California (CA). In common garden experiments, we examined the relative importance of quantitative trait variation, precipitation, and phenotypic plasticity in invasiveness. In two very different environments, plants showed no differences by state of origin (HI, CA, AZ) in aboveground biomass, seeds/flower, and total seed number. Plants from different states were also similar within watering treatment. Plants with supplemental watering, relative to unwatered plants, had greater biomass, specific leaf area (SLA), and total seed number, but did not differ in seeds/flower. Progeny grown from seeds produced under different watering treatments showed no maternal effects in seed mass, germination, biomass or SLA. High phenotypic plasticity, rather than local adaptation is likely responsible for variation in invasiveness. Global change models indicate that temperature and precipitation patterns over the next several decades will change, although the direction of change is uncertain. Drier summers in southern California may retard further invasion, while wetter summers may favor the spread of fountain grass."

 "AbstractText": "Despite the increasing biological and economic impacts of invasive species, little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that favor geographic range expansion and evolution of invasiveness in introduced species. Here, we focus on the invasive wetland grass Phalaris arundinacea L. and document the evolutionary consequences that resulted from multiple and uncontrolled introductions into North America of genetic material native to different European regions. Continental-scale genetic variation occurring in reed canarygrass' European range has been reshuffled and recombined within North American introduced populations, giving rise to a number of novel genotypes. This process alleviated genetic bottlenecks throughout reed canarygrass' introduced range, including in peripheral populations, where depletion of genetic diversity is expected and is observed in the native range. Moreover, reed canarygrass had higher genetic diversity and heritable phenotypic variation in its invasive range relative to its native range. The resulting high evolutionary potential of invasive populations allowed for rapid selection of genotypes with higher vegetative colonization ability and phenotypic plasticity. Our results show that repeated introductions of a single species may inadvertently create harmful invaders with high adaptive potential. Such invasive species may be able to evolve in response to changing climate, allowing them to have increasing impact on native communities and ecosystems in the future. More generally, multiple immigration events may thus trigger future adaptation and geographic spread of a species population by preventing genetic bottlenecks and generating genetic novelties through recombination."

 "AbstractText": "* Plants must cope with environmental variation in space and time. Phenotypic plasticity allows them to adjust their form and function to small-scale variations in habitat quality. Empirical studies have shown that stoloniferous plants can exploit heterogeneous habitats through plastic ramet specialization and internal resource exchange (division of labour). * Here we present a spatially explicit simulation model to explore costs and benefits of plasticity in spatio-temporally heterogeneous environments. We investigated the performance of three plant strategies in pairwise competition. The nonplastic strategy was unable to specialize. The autonomous plastic strategy displayed localized responses to external resource signals. In the coordinated plastic strategy, localized responses could be modified by internal demand signals from connected modules. * Plasticity in resource uptake proved beneficial in a broad range of environments. Modular coordination was beneficial under virtually all realistic conditions, especially if resource supplies did not closely match resource needs. * The benefits of division of labour extend considerably beyond the parameter combination covered by empirical studies. Our model provides a general framework for evaluating the benefits, costs and limits of plasticity in spatio-temporally heterogeneous habitats."

"ArticleTitle": "Tissue age affects calcification in the scleractinian coral Madracis mirabilis.",
"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "20-8" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In this study, two factorial experiments were used to investigate the role of tissue age in affecting the phenotypic expression of calcification in scleractinian corals. Both experiments tested whether calcification was altered by tissue age and whether corals of different ages exploit plasticity to differing degrees by altering calcification rates under new environmental conditions. To isolate age and size effects, branches of the Caribbean coral Madracis mirabilis were broken into a distal portion that was functionally young and a proximal portion that was functionally old. Fragments were transplanted from a deep (17 m) to a shallow (9 m) site in a Jamaican lagoon to test whether age affected the plasticity of calcification. Both experiments demonstrated that calcification scaled isometrically in the two age groups, and although scaling exponents were indistinguishable statistically among ages, young fragments calcified faster than old fragments. Thus, the effect of age on calcification rate was absolute and independent of size. However, the interactive effect of age and depth was not significant, demonstrating that ability to alter calcification rate (i.e., the extent of phenotypic plasticity for this trait) was unaffected by age. Together, these patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that the proximal modules (i.e., polyps) of M. mirabilis are subject to physiological senescence, as has been reported for other clonal organisms, including algae, fungi, plants, bryozoans, ascidians, and other cnidarians."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The goal of this short review is to consider the interrelated phenomena of phenotypic variation and genetic constraint with respect to plant diversity. The unique aspects of plants, including sessile habit, modular growth and diverse developmental programs expressed at the phytomer level, merit a specific examination of the genetic basis of their phenotypic variation, and how they experience and escape genetic constraint. Numerous QTL studies with wild and domesticated plants reveal that most phenotypic traits are polygenic but vary in the number and effect of the loci contributing, from a few loci of large effects to many with small effects. Further, somatic mutations, developmental plasticity and epigenetic variation, especially gene methylation, can contribute to increases in phenotypic variation. The flip side of these processes, genetic constraint, can similarly be the result of many factors, including pleiotropy, canalization and genetic redundancy. Genetic constraint is not only a mechanism to prevent change, however, it can also serve to direct evolution along certain paths. Ultimately, genetic constraint often comes full circle and is released through events such as hybridization, genome duplication and epigenetic remodeling. We are just beginning to understand how these processes can operate simultaneously during the evolution of ecologically important traits in plants."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Banksia species (Proteaceae) occur on some of the most phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils in the world. We hypothesized that plasticity in the exudation of P-mobilizing carboxylates would be greater in widespread than in rare Banksia species. Glasshouse experiments were conducted to identify and quantify carboxylate exudation in three widespread and six narrowly distributed Banksia species. High concentrations of carboxylates (predominantly malate, citrate, aconitate, oxalate) were measured in the rhizosphere of all nine species of Banksia on six different soils, but widespread species did not have greater plasticity in the composition of exuded carboxylates. Based on the evidence in the present study, rarity in Banksia cannot be explained by limited phenotypic adjustment of carboxylate exudation."

 "AbstractText": "Based on the anatomical observations of leaf and secondary xylem as well as the measurements of leaf water physiological parameters, this paper studied the anatomical and water physiological plasticity of Grewia biloba var. parviflora growing in different succession stage communities. The results showed that G. biloba var. parviflora leaf was characterized by thin bifacial with thin cuticle and few stoma, indicating that it was mesophyte anatomically, while the secondary xylem had typical xeromorphic traits, such as short and thin vessel, high vessel frequency, low percentage single pores, and short fibers and rays. G. biloba var. parviflora had high plasticity in the anatomical structure and water physiological features of leaf and secondary xylem, and the plasticity index was in the order of secondary xylem anatomical structure (0. 24) > water physiological traits (0. 19) > leaf anatomical structure (0. 18). Compared with those growing in mixed forest and Platycladus orientalis forest, the individuals of G. biloba var. parviflora in shrub communities had the xeromorphic traits in the aspects of (1) their secondary xylem had shorter vessel elements, higher vessel frequency, less single porous percentage, lower rays, higher relative conductivity and lower vulnerability index, and (2) their leaf had lower water potential, lower water content and free water content, higher bound water content, high ratio of bound to free water content, and less specific leaf area. The phenotypic plasticity, both anatomical and physiological, made G. biloba var. parviflora tolerate to the drought at earlier succession stages and better adapt to the mesophytic condition at later stages, and consequently, become a widely distributed and dominant species in mixed forests."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The physiological adjustment of organisms in response to temperature variation is a crucial part of coping with environmental stress. An important component of the cold response is the increase in membrane lipid unsaturation, and this has been linked to an enhanced resistance to the debilitating or lethal effects of cold. Underpinning the lipid response is the upregulation of fatty acid desaturases (des), particularly those introducing double bonds at the 9-10 position of saturated fatty acids. For plants and microbes there is good genetic evidence that regulation of des genes, and the consequent changes in lipid saturation, are causally linked to generation of a cold-tolerant phenotype. In animals, however, supporting evidence is almost entirely limited to correlations of saturation with cold conditions. We describe our recent attempts to provide a direct test of this relationship by genetic manipulation of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that this species displays a strong cold tolerant phenotype induced by prior conditioning to cold, and that this is directly linked to upregulated des activity. However, whilst genetic disruption of des activity and lipid unsaturation significantly reduced cold tolerance, animals retained a substantial component of their stress tolerant phenotype produced by cold conditioning. This indicates that mechanisms other than lipid unsaturation play an important role in cold adaptation."

 "AbstractText": "* Here we explore life history differences in a set of neighbouring metallicolous and nonmetallicolous populations of the heavy metal tolerant plant Thlaspi caerulescens. * We contrasted data from field observations and from a common garden experiment, in which soil zinc (Zn) concentration and light availability were manipulated, and data on microsatellite molecular variation. * The two ecotypes showed few differences in life history in the field, but large differences in their response to Zn concentration in the common garden. Soil toxicity affected most characters in nonmetallicolous plants, while it had no effect on metallicolous plants. The two ecotypes responded similarly to light. Genetic differentiation for quantitative characters between ecotypes contrasted with the absence of differentiation for microsatellites. Conversely, populations of the same ecotype showed similar responses to Zn, despite their high differentiation for molecular markers. * We conclude that divergent selection related to soil toxicity has had a predominant role in shaping life history differences between ecotypes, gene flow weakly opposing local adaptation despite geographical proximity."

 "AbstractText": "* We examined phenotypic plasticity of fitness components in response to zinc (Zn) in the Zn hyperaccumulator, Thlaspi caerulescens. * Two populations from Zn-enriched soils (M) and two populations from normal soils (NM) were grown in pots at three Zn concentrations (0, 1000 and 8000 mg kg(-1) Zn), for an entire life cycle. Growth, Zn accumulation and fitness components were assessed. * Based on vegetative growth, M and NM populations had similar Zn tolerance at 1000 mg kg(-1) Zn. However, reproductive output was markedly decreased in NM at 1000 and 8000 mg kg(-1) Zn. In M populations, Zn did not affect fitness. However, low Zn status enhanced reproductive output in year 1 compared with year 2 and decreased survival after the first flowering season. * M populations are able to achieve equal fitness across a broad range of Zn concentrations in soil by different combinations of fecundity and longevity. No cost of higher tolerance was demonstrated in M populations. Reproductive traits appeared to be a more sensitive indicator of tolerance than vegetative growth."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity enables many damaged plants to increase nectar secretion rates from extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), or in the case of broad bean, Vicia faba L. to produce additional EFNs, to attract natural enemies of herbivores. While plants benefit greatly from these defensive mutualisms, the costs of producing EFNs are largely unknown. We hypothesized that if EFN production is costly, then damaged plants with high resource levels would be able to produce more EFNs than plants that are resource-limited. Here, we show that this indirect inducible defence does follow this general pattern. Vicia faba enriched with 6 or 12 g of 14:14:14 NPK fertilizer increased EFN numbers after leaf damage by 46 and 60%, respectively, compared with nutrient-poor plants. Thus, EFN production is both damage- and resource-dependent. Analogous to direct defences, production of EFNs may limit the overall loss of leaf tissue when risk of herbivory increases."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Leaf morphology may vary considerably even within a branch of Passiflora suberosa plants. Leaves are of a typical green type in shaded areas, but in open fields turn into violet, and apparently have greater thickness and trichome density. The proximate causes and the adaptive meaning, if any, for the existence of the violet morph are still unknown. By cultivating P. suberosa clones under two light regimes (total and partial exposure to sunlight), we consecutively induced (first year) and then reversed (second year) the appearance of the violet morph. We evaluated the corresponding changes in morpho-anatomic and chemical leaf characteristics. Plants that were grown under partial sunlight had a greater size and did not alter their green color, but those grown under total sunlight changed into violet, were smaller in size and their leaves were tougher, thicker, and had a greater number of trichomes. The violet morph had increased anthocyanins and phenolic derivatives. It also showed cellular hypertrophy, a greater number of cell layers in the mesophyll, and a lignified pericycle. Since these morphs are interchangeable by changing light conditions, we inferred that they are not determined by genotypic diversity, but are mainly a result of a physiological response to light stress, and thus part of P. suberosa phenotypic plasticity."

 "AbstractText": "In a greenhouse study, we evaluated the effect of the light environment and support availability on the induction of tropane alkaloids (TAs) after leaf damage in the twining vine Convolvulus arvensis. We also tested whether leaf damage modifies the phenotypic responses of the plant to shade and physical support. We found a consistent pattern of induction of TAs after leaf damage in each environmental condition. The induction of TAs was differentially affected by combinations of support and light treatments. In the sun, prostrate and climbing vines exhibited similar induced responses. In the shade, prostrate vines showed greater induced responses. Thus, vines showed the greatest chemical induction when damage occurred in a resource-poor environment (shade), and there was no cue (support) of future increase in resource uptake. Damaged plants showed reduced plasticity to shading in leaf shape and internodes and petiole length in comparison with control, undamaged plants. Herbivory and/or induced responses to herbivory may limit adaptive plant responses to the environment. Therefore, the negative consequences of herbivory on plant fitness might be magnified in a context of changing environments."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Low Ca/Mg ratios (a defining component of serpentine soils) and low water environmental conditions often co-occur in nature and are thought to exert strong selection pressures on natural populations. However, few studies test the individual and combined effects of these environmental factors. We investigated the effects of low Ca/Mg ratio and low water availability on plant leaf, stem, stolon, and floral traits of Mimulus guttatus, a bodenvag species, i.e., a species that occurs in serpentine and non-serpentine areas. We quantified genetic variation and genetic variation for plasticity for these leaf, stem, stolon, and floral traits at three hierarchical levels: field-habitat type, population, and family, and we evaluated the relative importance of local adaptation and plasticity. We chose two populations and 10 families per population from four distinct field \"habitat types\" in northern California: high Ca/Mg ratio (non-serpentine) and season-long water availability, high Ca/Mg ratio and seasonally drying, low Ca/Mg ratio (serpentine) and season-long water availability, and low Ca/Mg ratio and seasonally drying. Seedlings were planted into greenhouse treatments that mimicked the four field conditions. We only detected genetic variation for stem diameter and length of longest leaf at the field-habitat level, but we detected genetic variation at the family level for nearly all traits. Soil chemistry and water availability had strong phenotypic effects, alone and in combination. Our hypothesis of an association between responses to low water levels and low Ca/Mg ratio was upheld for length of longest leaf, stem diameter, corolla width, and total number of reproductive units, whereas for other traits, responses to Ca/Mg ratio and low water were clearly independent. Our results suggest that traits may evolve independently from Ca/Mg ratios and water availability and that our focal traits were not simple alternative measures of vigor. We found genetic variation for plasticity both at the field-habitat type and family levels for half of the traits studied. Phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation for plasticity appear to be more important than local adaptation in the success of these M. guttatus populations found across a heterogeneous landscape in northern California. Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism maintaining the broad ecological breadth of native populations of M. guttatus."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Methods such as mRNA expression profiling have provided a vast amount of genomic and transcriptomic information about plants and other organisms. However, there is explicit indication that considerable metabolic control is executed on the metabolite and on the protein level including protein modifications, thereby constituting the phenotypic plasticity. Consequently, the analysis of the molecular phenotype demands the step toward mass spectrometry (MS)-based postgenomic techniques such as metabolomics and proteomics. This chapter describes a straightforward protocol for simultaneously extracting metabolites and proteins from the same biological sample in preparation for MS analysis. Furthermore, protocols for profiling polar metabolites using gas chromatography time-of-flight MS and for shotgun proteomics using liquid chromatography-MS are discussed. A practical course is laid out that outlines all the basic steps, from harvesting to data analysis. These steps enable the correlative study of metabolite and protein dynamics with minimal technical variation. Biological variability of independent samples is exploited for variance analysis and pattern recognition."

 "AbstractText": "Fundamental plant traits such as support, anchorage, and protection against environmental stress depend substantially on biomechanical design. The costs, subsequent trade-offs, and effects on plant performance of mechanical traits are not well understood, but it appears that many of these traits have evolved in response to abiotic and biotic mechanical forces and resource deficits. The relationships between environmental stresses and mechanical traits can be specific and direct, as in responses to strong winds, with structural reinforcement related to plant survival. Some traits such as leaf toughness might provide protection from multiple forms of stress. In both cases, the adaptive value of mechanical traits may vary between habitats, so is best considered in the context of the broader growth environment, not just of the proximate stress. Plants can also show considerable phenotypic plasticity in mechanical traits, allowing adjustment to changing environments across a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, it is not always clear whether a mechanical property is adaptive or a consequence of the physiology associated with stress. Mechanical traits do not only affect plant survival; evidence suggests they have downstream effects on ecosystem organization and functioning (e.g., diversity, trophic relationships, and productivity), but these remain poorly explored."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-messenger RNA is a common phenomenon that creates different transcripts from a single gene, and these alternative transcripts affect phenotypes. The majority of AS research has examined tissue and developmental specificity of expression of particular AS transcripts, how this specificity affects cell function, and how aberrant AS is related to disease. Few studies have examined quantitative between-individual variation in AS within a cell or tissue type, or in relation to phenotypes, but the results are compelling: quantitative variation in AS affects plastic traits such as stress, anxiety, fear, egg production, muscle performance, energetics and plant growth. Genomic analyses of AS are also at a nascent stage, but have revealed a number of significant evolutionary patterns. Growing knowledge of upstream genes and kinases that regulate AS provides the as-yet little explored potential to examine how these genes and pathways respond to environmental and genotype variables. Research in this area can provide glimpses of a labyrinth of genetic architectures that have rarely been considered in evolutionary and organismal biology, or in quantitative genetics. The scarcity of contribution to knowledge about AS from these fields is illustrated by the fact that heritability of quantitative variation in AS has not yet been determined for any gene in any organism. New research tactics that incorporate quantitative analyses of AS will allow organismal and evolutionary biologists to attain a fuller mechanistic understanding of many of the traits they study, and may lead to more rapid discovery of functionally important polymorphisms."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "7111-22"

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Pseudomonas fluorescens Q8r1-96 produces 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), a polyketide antibiotic that suppresses a wide variety of soilborne fungal pathogens, including Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, which causes take-all disease of wheat. Strain Q8r1-96 is representative of the D-genotype of 2,4-DAPG producers, which are exceptional because of their ability to aggressively colonize and maintain large populations on the roots of host plants, including wheat, pea, and sugar beet. In this study, three genes, an sss recombinase gene, ptsP, and orfT, which are important in the interaction of Pseudomonas spp. with various hosts, were investigated to determine their contributions to the unusual colonization properties of strain Q8r1-96. The sss recombinase and ptsP genes influence global processes, including phenotypic plasticity and organic nitrogen utilization, respectively. The orfT gene contributes to the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in plants and animals and is conserved among saprophytic rhizosphere pseudomonads, but its function is unknown. Clones containing these genes were identified in a Q8r1-96 genomic library, sequenced, and used to construct gene replacement mutants of Q8r1-96. Mutants were characterized to determine their 2,4-DAPG production, motility, fluorescence, colony morphology, exoprotease and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, carbon and nitrogen utilization, and ability to colonize the rhizosphere of wheat grown in natural soil. The ptsP mutant was impaired in wheat root colonization, whereas mutants with mutations in the sss recombinase gene and orfT were not. However, all three mutants were less competitive than wild-type P. fluorescens Q8r1-96 in the wheat rhizosphere when they were introduced into the soil by paired inoculation with the parental strain."

 "AbstractText": "For insects that develop inside discrete hosts, both host size and host quality constrain offspring growth, influencing the evolution of body size and life history traits. Using a two-generation common garden experiment, we quantified the contribution of maternal and rearing hosts to differences in growth and life history traits between populations of the seed-feeding beetle Stator limbatus that use a large-seeded host, Acacia greggii, and a small-seeded host, Pseudosamanea guachapele. Populations differed genetically for all traits when beetles were raised in a common garden. Contrary to expectations from the local adaptation hypothesis, beetles from all populations were larger, developed faster and had higher survivorship when reared on seeds of A. greggii (the larger host), irrespective of their native host. We observed two host plant-mediated maternal effects: offspring matured sooner, regardless of their rearing host, when their mothers were reared on P. guachapele (this was not caused by an effect of rearing host on egg size), and females laid larger eggs on P. guachapele. This is the first study to document plasticity by S. limbatus in response to P. guachapele, suggesting that plasticity is an ancestral trait in S. limbatus that likely plays an important role in diet expansion. Although differences between populations in growth and life history traits are likely adaptations to their host plants, host-associated maternal effects, partly mediated by maternal egg size plasticity, influence growth and life history traits and likely play an important role in the evolution of the breadth of S. limbatus' diet. More generally, phenotypic plasticity mediates the fitness consequences of using novel hosts, likely facilitating colonization of new hosts, but also buffering herbivores from selection post-colonization. Plasticity in response to novel versus normal hosts varied among our study populations such that disentangling the historical role of plasticity in mediating diet evolution requires the consideration of evolutionary history."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Invasion biologists often suggest that phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in successful plant invasions. Assuming that plasticity enhances ecological niche breadth and therefore confers a fitness advantage, recent studies have posed two main hypotheses: (1) invasive species are more plastic than non-invasive or native ones; (2) populations in the introduced range of an invasive species have evolved greater plasticity than populations in the native range. These two hypotheses largely reflect the disparate interests of ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Because these sciences are typically interested in different temporal and spatial scales, we describe what is required to assess phenotypic plasticity at different levels. We explore the inevitable tradeoffs of experiments conducted at the genotype vs. species level, outline components of experimental design required to identify plasticity at different levels, and review some examples from the recent literature. Moreover, we suggest that a successful invader may benefit from plasticity as either (1) a Jack-of-all-trades, better able to maintain fitness in unfavourable environments; (2) a Master-of-some, better able to increase fitness in favourable environments; or (3) a Jack-and-master that combines some level of both abilities. This new framework can be applied when testing both ecological or evolutionary oriented hypotheses, and therefore promises to bridge the gap between the two perspectives."

 "AbstractText": "We investigated the differential roles of physiological and morphological features on seedling survivorship along an experimental irradiance gradient in four dominant species of cool temperate-Mediterranean forests (Quercus robur L., Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus pinaster Ait.). The lowest photochemical efficiency (F(v)/F(m) in dark-adapted leaves) was reached in deep shade (1% of full sunlight) in all species except Q. robur, which had the lowest photochemical efficiency in both deep shade and 100% of full sunlight. Species differed significantly in their survival in 1% of full sunlight but exhibited similar survivorship in 6, 20 and 100% of full sunlight. Shade-tolerant oaks had lower leaf area ratios, shoot to root ratios, foliage allocation ratios and higher rates of allocation to structural biomass (stem plus thick roots) than shade-intolerant pines. Overall phenotypic plasticity for each species, estimated as the difference between the minimum and the maximum mean values of the ecophysiological variables studied at the various irradiances divided by the maximum mean value of those variables, was inversely correlated with shade tolerance. Observed morphology, allocation and plasticity conformed to a conservative resource-use strategy, although observed differences in specific leaf area, which was higher in shade-tolerant species, supported a carbon gain maximization strategy. Lack of a congruent suite of traits underlying shade tolerance in the studied species provides evidence of adaptation to multiple selective forces. Although the study was based on only four species, the importance of ecophysiological variables as determinants of interspecific differences in survival in limiting light was demonstrated."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The most recent revision of the genus Chlorella, based on biochemical and SSU rDNA analyses, suggested a reduction to a set of four \"true\" spherical Chlorella species, while a growing number of morphologically different species such as Micractinium (formerly Micractiniaceae) were found to cluster within the clade of \"true\"Chlorella. In this study, the generic concept in Chlorellaceae to Chlorella and Micractinium was evaluated by means of combined SSU and ITS-2 rDNA sequence analyses and biotests to induce development of bristles on the cell wall. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of Chlorella and Micractinium strains confirmed their separation into two different genera. In addition, non-homoplasious synapomorphies (NHS) and compensatory base changes (CBC) in the secondary structures of SSU and ITS-2 rDNA sequences were found for both genera using this approach. The Micractinium clade can be differentiated into three different genotypes. Using culture medium of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, phenotypic plasticity in Chlorella and Micractinium was studied. Non-bristled Micractinium cells developed bristles during incubation with Brachionus culture medium, whereas Chlorella did not produce bristles. Grazing experiments with Brachionus showed the rotifer preferred to feed on non-bristled cells. The dominance of colonies versus solitary cells in the Micractinium culture was not correlated with the \"Brachionus factor\". These results suggest that morphological characteristics like formation of bristles represent phenotypic adaptations to the conditions in the ecosystem."

 "AbstractText": "How the traits of invasive plants determine their invasiveness is one of the major issues in invasion biology. Invasive plants usually have higher ability of adaptation, reproduction and dispersal, and thus, make them exploit a great diversity of habitats. Phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation are the two major strategies that alien invasive plants can adapt habitat heterogeneity. The polymorphism of invasive plants and the diversity of their dispersal way enable them occupying invaded habitat quickly, and dispersing with a far range. The breeding strategies that agamogenesis and amphigenesis can coexist and trade off according to the habitat and invasive stage can not only promote the invasive population erupted massively, but also directly affect the dispersal mechanism and regulate the genetic structure of the population. Efficient competition of resource utilization and interfering competition based on allelopathy make invasive plants more invasively."

 "AbstractText": "In this paper, a comparative study was made on the growth, morphology, biomass allocation, and photosynthesis of two invasive plant species Ageratina adenophora and Chromolaena odorata under five soil phosphorus levels, aimed to know how the test plant species acclimate to the changes of soil phosphorus level, evaluate which plant traits were associated with the invasiveness of the two species, and know whether the increased level of soil phosphorus could facilitate their invasion. The results showed that the two species had considerable phenotypic plasticity and ? phosphorus acclimation ability. At low phosphorus levels, their root mass ratio increased, which could enhance the nutrient capture ability, while at high phosphorus levels, their specific leaf area, maximum net photosynthetic rate, light saturation point, and chlorophyll and carotenoid contents per unit area were high, and the assimilative capacity and area increased, which could facilitate their carbon gain. A. adenophora had higher phosphorus acclimation ability than C. odorata. With the increase of phosphorous level, the relative growth rate, total biomass, branch number, leaf area index, and maximum net photosynthetic rate of the two species increased significantly, and most of the parameters were not decreased significantly under over-optimal phosphorus level. The two species could grow better under high phosphorus levels which were usually excessive and/or harmful for most native species, and enhanced soil phosphorus level might promote their invasion. At high phosphorus levels, the two invasive plant species might shade out native species through increasing their plant height, branch number, and leaf area index. The two species could maintain relatively high growth rate under high phosphorus levels in dry season when native plant species almost stopped growing. The ability that the invasive plant species could temporally use natural resources which native plant species could not use was also associated with their invasiveness."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be a major mechanism allowing sessile organisms such as plants to adapt to environmental heterogeneity. However, the adaptive value of many common plastic responses has not been tested by linking these responses to fitness. Even when plasticity is adaptive, costs of plasticity, such as the energy necessary to maintain regulatory pathways for plastic responses, may constrain its evolution. We used a greenhouse experiment to test whether plastic physiological responses to soil water availability (wet vs. dry conditions) were adaptive and/or costly in the congeneric wildflowers Lobelia cardinalis and L. siphilitica. Eight physiological traits related to carbon and water uptake were measured. Specific leaf area (SLA), photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), and photosynthetic capacity (Amax) responded plastically to soil water availability in L. cardinalis. Plasticity in Amax was maladaptive, plasticity in A and g(s) was adaptive, and plasticity in SLA was adaptively neutral. The nature of adaptive plasticity in L. cardinalis, however, differed from previous studies. Lobelia cardinalis plants with more conservative water use, characterized by lower g(s), did not have higher fitness under drought conditions. Instead, well-watered L. cardinalis that had higher g(s) had higher fitness. Only Amax responded plastically to drought in L. siphilitica, and this response was adaptively neutral. We detected no costs of plasticity for any physiological trait in either L. cardinalis or L. siphilitica, suggesting that the evolution of plasticity in these traits would not be constrained by costs. Physiological responses to drought in plants are presumed to be adaptive, but our data suggest that much of this plasticity can be adaptively neutral or maladaptive."

 "AbstractText": "Plants only interact with neighbors over restricted distances, so local conditions are of great significance for plants. It is therefore important to consider spatial structure and neighborhood effects if we are to understand plants' strategies. We constructed a spatially-explicit, game theory model to explore optimal height growth at the individual-level. In the model, there is no ESS for height growth at the population level, because there is an \"instantaneous\" optimal height growth strategy for the individual plant that changes depending on the local light environment. The optimal strategy is plasticity in response to local conditions. Game-theoretic models for plant phenotypic traits should move from \"mean-field approximations\" towards explicit modeling of local interactions."

By way of introduction, a brief historical reminiscence describes the discovery of CAM in Clusia and the consequent increase in interest in studying this particular genus of tropical shrubs and trees. The molecular phylogeny of CAM in the genus is compared with that in Kalanchoë and the Bromeliaceae. At the level of metabolism and photosynthesis, the great plasticity of expression of photosynthetic physiotypes, i.e. (i) C(3) photosynthesis, (ii) CAM including CAM idling, (iii) CAM cycling and (iv) C(3)/CAM-intermediate behaviour, as well as metabolic flexibility in Clusia is illustrated. At the level of autecology, the factors water, irradiance and temperature, which control photosynthetic flexibility, are assessed. The phenotypic plasticity of physiotypes and morphotypes is described. At the level of synecology, the ecological amplitude of Clusia in the tropics and the relations to habitat are surveyed."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Cardiac phenotypic plasticity (so-called cardiac remodelling, CR) is characterized by changes in myocardial structure that happen in response to either mechanical overload or a loss of substance such as that occurring after myocardial infarction. Mechanosensation is a widespread biological process and is inextricably mixed with other transduction systems from hormones and vasopeptides, which ultimately produce post-translational modifications of transcription factors. The expression of the four main transcription factors during cardiogenesis is also enhanced as a link to foetal reprogramming. CR results from re-expression of the foetal programme, which is mostly adaptive, but also from several other phenotypic modifications that are not usually adaptive, such as fibrosis. (i) The initial determinant is mechanical, and re-expression of the foetal programme includes a global increase in genetic expression with cardiac hypertrophy, re-expression of genes that are normally not expressed in the adult ventricles, repression of genes not expressed during the foetal life, and activation of pre-exisiting stem cells. Microarray technology has revealed a coordinated change in expression of genes pertaining to signal transduction, metabolic function, structure and motility, and cell organism defence. The physiological consequence is a better adapted muscle. (ii) During clinical conditions, the effects of mechanics are modified by several interfering determinants that modify CR, including senescence, obesity, diabetes, ischemia and the neurohormonal reaction. Each of these factors can alter myocardial gene expression and modify molecular remodelling of mechanical origin. Finally, as compared to evolutionary phenotypic plasticity described in plants and insects in response to variations in environmental conditions, in CR, the environmental factor is internal, plasticity is primarily adaptive, and it involves coordinated changes in over 1400 genes. Study of reaction norms showed that the genotypes from different animal species are similarly plastic, but there are transgenic models in which adaptation to mechanics is not caused by hypertrophy but by qualitative changes in gene expression."

 "AbstractText": "Although phenotypic plasticity is demonstrably adaptive in a range of settings, organisms are not perfectly plastic. Costs of plasticity comprise one factor predicted to counter the evolution of this adaptive strategy, yet evidence of costs is rare. Here, we test the fitness effects of plastic life-history and morphological responses to density and costs of this plasticity in recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Several costs of plasticity and homeostasis were detected. Of particular relevance, there was a significant cost of plasticity to active stem-elongation responses, an adaptive trait in many species. There was also a cost of plasticity to apical branch production at both high and low density, which resulted from the greater suppression of basal branching in genotypes with plastic apical branch production relative to genotypes with fixed apical branch production. The presence of a cost in multiple environments (i.e., a global cost) is predicted to counter the evolution of plasticity. Experimental segregating progenies such as the one used here are expected to have higher genetic costs of plasticity than arrays of genotypes sampled from natural populations because selection should remove genotypes with costs resulting from linkage disequilibrium or epistasis. The use of experimental progeny arrays therefore increases the ability to evaluate genetic costs."

 "AbstractText": "The ability of a genotype to change its phenotype was once considered rather a nuisance -- making it difficult to define a genotype. This led to the idea that there was a problem called 'instability'. But quite early it was recognized that stability was under genetic control, and was a character like other attributes of an individual. From this realization came the idea that there were two sides to the character of 'instability', and that the ability to change could be important. This ability was thus given the title of 'plasticity'. Once recognized, it became clear from surveys of different species and populations that plasticity can (i) be a complex character, and (ii) be selected to fit species to the particular demands of different environments. For plants, which cannot meet variations in environment like animals by behavioural responses, phenotypic plasticity can be very important. Plants should therefore be valuable tools for unravelling the mechanisms of plasticity whilst also demonstrating its contribution to fitness experimentally. We ought also to be able to demonstrate that appropriate genetic variability is available through which complex responses can be built up by selection. Genes must exist not only to determine character means, but also to determine character response, which adds interesting complexity to our ideas about evolution."

 "AbstractText": "The genetic and ecological basis of viability and developmental time differences between Drosophila buzzatii and D. koepferae were analysed using the isofemale line technique. Several isofemale lines were sampled from pairs of allopatric/sympatric populations of each species. Flies were reared in media prepared with decaying tissues of two of the main natural cactus hosts of each species. This experimental design enabled us to evaluate the relative contribution of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation and genotype by environment interaction (G x E) to total phenotypic variation for two fitness traits, viability and developmental time. Our results revealed significant G x E in both traits, suggesting that the maintenance of genetic variation can be explained, at least in part, by diversifying selection in different patches of a heterogeneous environment in both species. However, the relative importance of the factors involved in the G x E varied between traits and populations within species. For viability, the G x E can be mainly attributed to changes in the rank order of lines across cacti. However, the pattern was different for developmental time. In D. buzzatii the G x E can be mainly accounted for by changes in among line variance across cacti, whereas changes in the rank order of lines across cacti was the main component in D. koepferae. These dissimilar patterns of variation between traits and species suggest that the evolutionary forces shaping genetic variation for developmental time and viability vary between populations within species and between species."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "720-8" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Timing of arrival at a resource often determines an individual's reproductive success. Tree-killing bark beetles can reproduce in healthy trees by attacking in adequate numbers to overcome host defences that could otherwise be lethal. This process is mediated by aggregation and antiaggregation pheromones. Beetles that arrive early in such a \"mass attack\" must contend with undiminished tree defences, and produce enough pheromones to attract more beetles, but have a head start on gallery construction and egg-laying. Beetles that arrive late may be impeded by competition and diminishing availability of phloem, but should experience fewer costs associated with pheromone production and battling tree defences. We investigated relationships between timing of arrival, body size, pheromone production and fitness in the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis. In field experiments, we captured beetles that arrived early (pioneers) and late on slash pine trees, Pinus elliottii, and measured pheromone amounts in their hindguts. We marked gallery entrances of beetles as they landed on a tree and measured their reproductive success after the attack terminated. We found no difference in body size or pheromone amounts between early and late arrivers. Most beetles arrived at the middle of the attack sequence, and excavated longer galleries per day than early arrivers. The number of offspring produced per day by beetles that established galleries midway through mass attack was higher than those that arrived early or very late in the sequence. Our results suggest that beetles do not exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in pre-landing pheromone production, depending on the extent of previous colonisation of a host. Rather, it appears that stabilising selection favours beetles that attack in the middle of the sequence, and contributes to attack synchrony. Synchronous attack on trees is essential before population booms characteristic of tree-killing bark beetles can occur in nature."

 "AbstractText": "Two hybrid poplar maternal half-sib families, resulting from controlled crosses of the female parent Populus deltoides 'S9-2' with P. nigra 'Ghoy' and P. trichocarpa 'V24', were grown at three sites: northern Italy, central France and southern England. Juvenile stem growth traits (height, circumference and volume) and sylleptic branchiness (number of branches, density of branches per unit of stem height, percentage of the stem carrying branches and distance of the highest sylleptic branch to the top of the stem) were measured on 1-year-old shoots. Our general objectives were to determine the degree to which the expression of stem growth and syllepsis and the relationships between them are affected by environmental conditions and to evaluate the efficiency of indirect selection for stem growth using branching traits as secondary criteria. The performance of both families differed significantly within and between sites. Pronounced heterosis was observed and highly significant genotype x environment interactions were found for all traits across the sites. Syllepsis showed more marked genetic variation and plasticity than stem growth traits. Relationships between sylleptic branchiness and stem growth depended on environmental conditions. Heritability values at the individual level ranged between 0.09 and 0.59, but genetic gain in stem volume was not significantly improved when selection was based on sylleptic branch characteristics. However, despite strong phenotypic plasticity among sites, genotypic ranking among the sites was relatively stable."

 "AbstractText": "Many workers have demonstrated a genetic basis for variation in inflorescence traits, but this variation can also have an environmental component. Because flowering can incur significant water costs, I estimated plasticity of inflorescence traits of three populations of Lobelia siphilitica in response to drought. I manipulated soil water availability in the greenhouse and measured seven inflorescence traits. Under drought conditions, plants from one population flowered later and produced fewer flowers with shorter corollas and narrower landing pads. In contrast, the height of the flowering stalk decreased in response to drought in all three populations. Consequently, pollinator-mediated natural selection on these plastic traits may depend on soil water availability. Plastic responses differed between genotypes only for the height of the flowering stalk and the length of the corolla tube and only in one or two populations. This suggests that genotype × environment interactions would not limit the evolution of inflorescence traits in L. siphilitica. The strength and sign of phenotypic correlations among inflorescence traits did not respond plastically to drought, suggesting that indirect selection on inflorescence traits of L. siphilitica will not vary strongly with water availability. My results suggest that plasticity of inflorescence traits may influence their evolution, but the effects are population- and trait-specific."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Yeast cells possess a remarkable capacity to adhere to abiotic surfaces, cells and tissues. These adhesion properties are of medical and industrial relevance. Pathogenic yeasts such as Candida albicans and Candida glabrata adhere to medical devices and form drug-resistant biofilms. In contrast, cell-cell adhesion (flocculation) is a desirable property of industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that allows the easy separation of cells from the fermentation product. Adhesion is conferred by a class of special cell wall proteins, called adhesins. Cells carry several different adhesins, each allowing adhesion to specific substrates. Several signalling cascades including the Ras/cAMP/PKA and MAP kinase (MAPK)-dependent filamentous growth pathways tightly control synthesis of the different adhesins. Together, these pathways trigger adhesion in response to stress, nutrient limitation or small molecules produced by the host, such as auxin in plants or NAD in mammals. In addition, adhesins are subject to subtelomeric epigenetic switching, resulting in stochastic expression patterns. Internal tandem repeats within adhesin genes trigger recombination events and the formation of novel adhesins, thereby offering fungi an endless reservoir of adhesion properties. These aspects of fungal adhesion exemplify the impressive phenotypic plasticity of yeasts, allowing them to adapt quickly to stressful environments and exploit new opportunities."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Cyanogenesis, the release of toxic HCN from damaged plant tissues, is generally considered as a constitutive plant defense. We found phenotypic plasticity of cyanogenesis in young leaves of lima bean Phaseolus lunatus based on increased activity of the beta-glucosidase in response to herbivore attack. Two aspects of plant cyanogenesis have to be considered in ecological analyses: (1) the cyanogenic potential (HCNp), which indicates the total amount of cyanide-containing compounds present in a given tissue, and (2) the cyanogenic capacity (HCNc), representing the release of HCN per unit time. This release is catalyzed by specific beta-glucosidases, whose activity is a crucial parameter determining overall toxicity. Enzymatic activity of beta-glucosidase-and, in consequence, the rate of HCN release-was increased significantly after 72 hr of incubation with spider mites as compared to non-infested leaves. Feeding by L1 larvae of Mexican bean beetles also led to enhanced enzymatic activity, whereas mechanical damage of leaf tissue had no effect on beta-glucosidase activity and the release of HCN. The results place plant cyanogenesis in the group of induced resistance traits, whose degree of activity depends on the feeding by a particular herbivore."

 "AbstractText": "Evolution of dimorphic breeding systems may involve changes in ecophysiological traits as well as floral morphology because of greater resource demands on females. Differences between related species suggest that ecophysiological traits should be heritable, and species with higher female frequencies should show greater sexual differentiation. We used modified partial diallel crossing designs to estimate narrow-sense heritabilities and genetic correlations of sex-specific ecophysiological and morphological traits in closely related gynodioecious Schiedea salicaria (13% females) and Schiedea adamantis (39% females). In S. salicaria, hermaphrodites and females differed in photosynthetic rate and specific leaf area (SLA). Narrow-sense heritabilities were significant for stomatal conductance, SLA and inflorescence number in hermaphrodites, and for SLA and inflorescence number in females. Schiedea adamantis had no sexual dimorphism in measured traits; stomatal conductance, stem number and inflorescence number were heritable in females, and stem number was heritable in hermaphrodites. In both species, significant genetic correlations of traits between sexes were rare, indicating that traits can evolve independently in response to sex-differential selection. Significant genetic correlations were detected between certain traits within sexes of both species. Low heritability of some ecophysiological traits may reflect low additive genetic variability or high phenotypic plasticity in these traits."

 "AbstractText": {
 "text": "There are three reasons for the increasing demand for crop models that build the plant on the basis of architectural principles and organogenetic processes: (1) realistic concepts for developing new crops need to be guided by such models; (2) there is an increasing interest in crop phenotypic plasticity, based on variable architecture and morphology; and (3) engineering of mechanized cropping systems requires information on crop architecture. The functional-structural model GREENLAB was recently presented that simulates resource-dependent plasticity of plant architecture. This study introduces a new methodology for crop parameter optimization against measured data called multi-fitting, validates the calibrated model for maize with independent field data, and describes a technique for 3D visualization of outputs.",

 "text": "Maize was grown near Beijing during the 2000, 2001 and 2003 (two sowing dates) summer seasons in a block design with four to five replications. Detailed morphological and topological observations were made on the plant architecture throughout the development of the four crops. Data obtained in 2000 was used to establish target files for parameter optimization using the generalized least square method, and parameter accuracy was evaluated by coefficient of variance. In situ plant digitization was used to establish 3D symbol files for organs that were then used to translate model outputs directly into 3D representations for each time step of model execution.",

 "text": "Multi-fitting against several target files obtained at different growth stages gave better parameter accuracy than single fitting at maturity only, and permitted extracting generic organ expansion kinetics from the static observations. The 2000 model gave excellent predictions of plant architecture and vegetative growth for the other three seasons having different temperature regimes, but predictions of inter-seasonal variability of biomass partitioning during grain filling were less accurate. This was probably due to insufficient consideration of processes governing cob sink size and terminal leaf senescence. Further perspectives for model improvement are discussed.",

 "AbstractText": "The subject of this review is the impact of long-term changes in temperature on plant growth and its underlying components. The discussion highlights the extent to which thermal acclimation of metabolism is intrinsically linked to the plasticity of a range of biochemical and morphological traits. The fact that there is often a trade-off between temperature-mediated changes in net assimilation rates (NAR) and biomass allocation [in particular the specific leaf area (SLA)] when plants are grown at different temperatures is also highlighted. Also discussed is the role of temperature-mediated changes in photosynthesis and respiration in determining NAR values. It is shown that in comparisons that do not take phylogeny into account, fast-growing species exhibit greater temperature-dependent changes in RGR, SLA, and NAR than slow-growing plants. For RGR and NAR, such trends are maintained within phylogenetically independent contrasts (i.e. species adapted to more-favourable habitats consistently exhibit greater temperature-mediated changes than their congeneric counterparts adapted to less-favourable habitats). By contrast, SLA was not consistently more thermally plastic in species from favourable habitats. Interestingly, biomass allocation between leaves and roots was consistently more plastic in slow-growing species within individual phylogenetically independent contrasts, when plants were grown under contrasting temperatures. Finally, how interspecific variations in NAR account for an increasing proportion of variability in RGR as growth temperatures decrease is highlighted. Conversely, SLA played a more dominant role in determining interspecific variability in RGR at higher growth temperatures; thus, the importance of SLA in determining interspecific variation in RGR could potentially increase if annual mean temperatures increase in the future."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "C4 photosynthesis is a complex specialization that enhances carbon gain in hot, often arid habitats where photorespiration rates can be high. Certain features unique to C4 photosynthesis may reduce the potential for phenotypic plasticity and photosynthetic acclimation to environmental change relative to what is possible with C3 photosynthesis. During acclimation, the structural and physiological integrity of the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) complex has to be maintained if C4 photosynthesis is to function efficiently in the new environment. Disruption of the M-BS structure could interfere with metabolic co-ordination between the C3 and C4 cycles, decrease metabolite flow rate between the tissues, increase CO2 leakage from the bundle sheath, and slow enzyme activity. C4 plants have substantial acclimation potential, but in most cases lag behind the acclimation responses in C3 plants. For example, some C4 species are unable to maintain high quantum yields when grown in low-light conditions. Others fail to reduce carboxylase content in shade, leaving substantial over-capacity of Rubisco and PEP carboxylase in place. Shade-tolerant C4 grasses lack the capacity for maintaining a high state of photosynthetic induction following sunflecks, and thus may be poorly suited to exploit subsequent sunflecks compared with C3 species. In total, the evidence indicates that C4 photosynthesis is less phenotypically plastic than C3 photosynthesis, and this may contribute to the more restricted ecological and geographical distribution of C4 plants across the Earth."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Covariation between light quality- and photoperiod-mediated phenotypic plasticity was investigated using Arabidopsis thaliana. Three episodes of artificial selection were imposed on an index that quantified the plastic response to reduced red to far-red ratios (R:FR), with higher index values indicating greater plasticity. Relative to control lines, two high plasticity (HP) lines showed 1.6- and 2.4-fold increases in the index; low plasticity (LP) lines showed 1.4- and 1.1-fold decreases. A factorial experiment combining high and low R:FR conditions with long and short photoperiods assessed indirect consequences of selection on plasticity. Despite divergent R:FR-mediated plasticities in HP vs. LP lines, all four lines showed increases in photoperiod-mediated responses and decreases in mean leaf number. Complex relationships among trait means, plasticities and underlying mechanisms caution against generalizing about the genetic architecture of plastic traits. Partially independent developmental and evolutionary responses to R:FR and photoperiod are somewhat unsurprising, given this species' cosmopolitan nature."

The plasticity apparent in leaf life span was similar in magnitude to the plasticity observed in specific leaf area and photosynthetic rate, implying that it has a significant impact on carbon gain efficiency when plants acclimate to different light regimes. In all species, median survival time was negatively correlated with leaf photosynthetic capacity (or its proxy, the nitrogen content per unit area) and leaf emergence rate.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Survival and growth of terrestrial plants is negatively affected by complete submergence. This is mainly the result of hampered gas exchange between plants and their environment, since gas diffusion is severely reduced in water compared with air, resulting in O2 deficits which limit aerobic respiration. The continuation of photosynthesis could probably alleviate submergence-stress in terrestrial plants, but its potential under water will be limited as the availability of CO2 is hampered. Several submerged terrestrial plant species, however, express plastic responses of the shoot which may reduce gas diffusion resistance and enhance benefits from underwater photosynthesis. In particular, the plasticity of the flooding-tolerant terrestrial species Rumex palustris turned out to be remarkable, making it a model species suitable for the study of these responses. During submergence, the morphology and anatomy of newly developed leaves changed: 'aquatic' leaves were thinner and had thinner cuticles. As a consequence, internal O2 concentrations and underwater CO2 assimilation rates were higher at the prevailing low CO2 concentrations in water. Compared with heterophyllous amphibious plant species, underwater photosynthesis rates of terrestrial plants may be very limited, but the effects of underwater photosynthesis on underwater survival are impressive. A combination of recently published data allowed quantification of the magnitude of the acclimation response in this species. Gas diffusion resistance in terrestrial leaves underwater was about 15,000 times higher than in air. Strikingly, acclimation to submergence reduced this factor to 400, indicating that acclimated leaves of R. palustris had an approximately 40 times lower gas diffusion resistance than non-acclimated ones."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Sexual dimorphism, or differences between the sexes, is pervasive in both plants and animals despite genetic and developmental constraints on its evolution. This special issue of the American Naturalist, which is based on the annual Vice Presidential Symposium, documents how the underlying processes responsible for the presence and extent of sexual dimorphism can be qualified and quantified by a variety of approaches. These include estimates of the G matrix and phenotypic selection, artificial selection, phenotypic manipulation of hormones, estimates of sex-differential sensitivity to maternal effects, among-population and phenotypic plasticity studies, and the mapping of sexual dimorphism onto a phylogeny. The questions addressed in the articles in this issue vary depending on the motivation for the studies and the taxa being investigated, but taken together, they show how the integration of genetic, developmental, physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches can illuminate the processes underlying the evolution of sexual dimorphism."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Marine macroalgae, especially the Rhodophyta, can be notoriously difficult to identify owing to their relatively simple morphology and anatomy, convergence, rampant phenotypic plasticity, and alternation of heteromorphic generations. It is thus not surprising that algal systematists have come to rely heavily on genetic tools for molecular assisted alpha taxonomy. Unfortunately the number of suitable marker systems in the three available genomes is enormous and, although most workers have settled on one of three or four models, the lack of an accepted standard hinders the comparison of results between laboratories. The advantages of a standard system are obvious for practical purposes of species discovery and identification; as well, compliance with a universal marker, such as cox1 being developed under the label 'DNA barcode', would allow algal systematists to benefit from the rapidly emerging technologies. Novel primers were developed for red algae to PCR amplify and sequence the 5' cox1 'barcode' region and were used to assess three known species-complex questions: (i) Mazzaella species in the Northeast Pacific; (ii) species of the genera Dilsea and Neodilsea in the Northeast Pacific; and (iii) Asteromenia peltata from three oceans. These models were selected because they have all caused confusion with regards to species number, distribution, and identification in the field, and because they have all been studied with molecular tools. In all cases the DNA barcode resolved accurately and unequivocally species identities and, with the enhanced sampling here, turned up a variety of novel observations in need of further taxonomic investigation."

 "AbstractText": "Bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) lines 'S156' (O3-sensitive)/'R123' (O3-tolerant) and cultivars 'BBL 290' (O3-sensitive)/'BBL 274' (O3-tolerant) were used to study the effects of O3 on stomatal conductance (gs), density, and aperture size on leaf and pod surfaces with the objective of establishing links between the degree of plant sensitivity to O3 and plasticity of stomatal properties in response to O3. Studies in open-top chambers (OTCs) and in continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) established a clear relationship between plant developmental stages, degrees of O3 sensitivity and gs: while 'S156' had higher gs rates than 'R123' earlier in development, similar differences between 'BBL 290' and 'BBL 274' were observed at later stages. Gs rates on the abaxial leaf surfaces of 'S156' and 'BBL 290', accompanied by low leaf temperatures, were significantly higher than their O3-tolerant counterparts. Exposure to O3 in CSTRs had greater and more consistent impacts on both stomatal densities and aperture sizes of O3-sensitive cultivars. Stomatal densities were highest on the abaxial leaf surfaces of 'S156' and 'BBL 290' at higher O3 concentrations (60 ppb), but the largest aperture sizes were recorded on the adaxial leaf surfaces at moderate O3 concentrations (30 ppb). Exposure to O3 eliminated aperture size differences on the adaxial leaf surfaces between sensitive and tolerant cultivars. Regardless of sensitivity to O3 and treatment regimes, the smallest aperture sizes and highest stomatal densities were found on the abaxial leaf surface. Our studies showed that O3 has the potential to affect stomatal plasticity and confirmed the presence of different control mechanisms for stomatal development on each leaf surface. This appeared to be more evident in O3-sensitive cultivars."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Sexual reproduction in animals and plants is far more prevalent than asexual reproduction, and there is no dearth of hypotheses attempting to explain why. Even bacteria and viruses, which reproduce by cloning, engage in promiscuous horizontal gene exchange (\"parasexual reproduction\") on such short time scales that they evolve genotypic diversity even more rapidly than eukaryotes. (We confront this daily in the form of antimicrobial resistance.) The host-parasite and host-pathogen arms race purports to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction, yet there are over a dozen other hypotheses, including the proposition that sexual reproduction purges the genome of deleterious mutations. An equally daunting challenge is to understand, in terms of evolutionary logic, the jungle of diverse courtship and mating strategies that we find in nature. The phenotypic plasticity of sex determination in animals suggests that the central nervous system and reproductive tract may not reach the same endpoint on the continuum between our stereotypic male and female extremes. Why are there only two kinds of gametes in most eukaryotes? Why are most flowering plants, and few animals, hermaphroditic? Why do male animals compete more for access to females than the other way around in most animals that have been studied?This review presents more questions than answers, but an extraordinary wealth of data has been collected, and new genetic techniques will provide new answers. The possible relevance of these data to human sexuality will be discussed in a future article."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Aneuploidies are common chromosomal defects that result in growth and developmental deficits and high levels of lethality in humans. To gain insight into the biology of aneuploidies, we manipulated mouse embryonic stem cells and generated a trans-species aneuploid mouse line that stably transmits a freely segregating, almost complete human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). This \"transchromosomic\" mouse line, Tc1, is a model of trisomy 21, which manifests as Down syndrome (DS) in humans, and has phenotypic alterations in behavior, synaptic plasticity, cerebellar neuronal number, heart development, and mandible size that relate to human DS. Transchromosomic mouse lines such as Tc1 may represent useful genetic tools for dissecting other human aneuploidies."

 "AbstractText": "Intelligent behavior is a complex adaptive phenomenon that has evolved to enable organisms to deal with variable environmental circumstances. Maximizing fitness requires skill in foraging for necessary resources (food) in competitive circumstances and is probably the activity in which intelligent behavior is most easily seen. Biologists suggest that intelligence encompasses the characteristics of detailed sensory perception, information processing, learning, memory, choice, optimisation of resource sequestration with minimal outlay, self-recognition, and foresight by predictive modeling. All these properties are concerned with a capacity for problem solving in recurrent and novel situations. Here I review the evidence that individual plant species exhibit all of these intelligent behavioral capabilities but do so through phenotypic plasticity, not movement. Furthermore it is in the competitive foraging for resources that most of these intelligent attributes have been detected. Plants should therefore be regarded as prototypical intelligent organisms, a concept that has considerable consequences for investigations of whole plant communication, computation and signal transduction."

 "AbstractText": "Fungi are one of the most important and widespread components of the biosphere, and are essential for the growth of over 90% of all vascular plants. Although they are a separate kingdom of life, we know relatively little about the origins of their ubiquitous existence. This reflects a wider ignorance arising from their status as indeterminate organisms epitomized by extreme phenotypic plasticity that is essential for survival in complex environments. Here we show that the fungal phenotype may have its origins in the defining characteristic of indeterminate organisms, namely their ability to recycle locally immobilized internal resources into a mobilized form capable of being directed to new internal sinks. We show that phenotype can be modelled as an emergent phenomenon resulting from the interplay between simple local processes governing uptake and remobilization of internal resources, and macroscopic processes associated with their transport. Observed complex growth forms are reproduced and the sensitive dependence of phenotype on environmental context may be understood in terms of nonlinearities associated with regulation of the recycling apparatus."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In spite of the term 'endophyte' being employed for all organisms that inhabit plants, mycologists have come to use the term 'fungal endophyte' for fungi that inhabit plants without causing visible disease symptoms. The term refers only to fungi at the moment of detection without regard for the future status of the interaction. This paper is a review of literature on non-balansiaceous fungi involved in asymptomatic colonisations of plants. These fungal endophytes represent a continuum of fungi with respect to physiological status, infection modus, colonisation pattern, secondary metabolism, life-history strategy, and developmental and evolutionary stages, but also with respect to the fungal and host taxa involved in the symbioses. We hypothesize that there are no neutral interactions, but rather that endophyte-host interactions involve a balance of antagonisms, irrespective of the plant organ infected. There is always at least a degree of virulence on the part of the fungus enabling infection, whereas defence of the plant host limits development of fungal invaders and disease. It is also hypothesized that the endophytes, in contrast to known pathogens, generally have far greater phenotypic plasticity and thus more options than pathogens: infection, local but also extensive colonisation, latency, virulence, pathogenity and (or) saprophytism. This phenotypic plasticity is a motor of evolution."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In plants organogenesis, cell differentiation and dedifferentiation are fundamental processes allowing high developmental plasticity. Such plasticity involved epigenetic mechanisms but limited knowledge is available concerning quantitative aspects. Three sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L. altissima) cell lines originating from the same mother plant and exhibiting graduate states of morphogenesis were used to assess whether these differences could be related or not to changes in DNA methylation levels. Methylcytosine percentages from 18.3 to 28.8% and distinct levels of DNA methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.37) activities were shown in the three cell lines. The lowest methylcytosine percentage was associated to organogenesis. In order to test the plasticity of these cell lines, various treatments causing DNA hypo or hypermethylation were performed at different times and concentrations. In this collection of treated lines with+/-10% of methylcytosine percentages, loss of organogenic properties and cell dedifferentiation were observed. As cell wall formation fits well with cell differentiation state, the lignification process was further investigated in treated and untreated lines as a biochemical marker of the phenotypic changes. For example, peroxidase specific activities (EC 1.11.1.7) varied from 0.7 to 0.02 pkat mg(-1) of protein in organogenic and dedifferentiated lines, respectively. A negative relationship between peroxidase activities, incorporation of cell wall-bound phenolic compounds as ferulate and sinapate derivatives and methylcytosine percentages was obtained. This is the first biochemical evidence that phenotypic changes in plant cells induced by DNA hypo- or hypermethylating treatments are correlated in a linear relationship to modifications of the cell wall differentiation state."

Significant plasticity for three traits in both experiments was found. In the clone experiments, a significant clone x time x density interaction was found, suggesting that plasticity for growth and stem form is under genetic control. In both experiments, density did not affect environmental correlation, which remained high throughout tree development. The impact of density on genetic correlation was marked in the clone experiment, with a reduced value at lower density, but was not observed in the family trial. The differences between clones and family are mainly explained by the distribution of genetic variation within and among genotypes.",

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Many plants proliferate roots in nutrient patches, presumably increasing nutrient uptake and plant fitness. Nutrient heterogeneity has been hypothesized to maintain community diversity because of a trade-off between the spatial extent over which plants forage (foraging scale) and their ability to proliferate roots precisely in nutrient patches (foraging precision). Empirical support for this hypothesis has been mixed, and some authors have suggested that interspecific differences in relative growth rate may be confounded with measurements of foraging precision. We collected previously published data from numerous studies of root foraging ability (foraging precision, scale, response to heterogeneity, and relative growth rate) and phylogenetic relationships for >100 plant species to test these hypotheses using comparative methods. Root foraging precision was phylogenetically and taxonomically conserved. Using a historical and phylogenetically independent contrast correlations, we found no evidence of a root foraging scale-precision trade-off, mixed support for a relative growth rate-precision relationship, and no support for the widespread assumption that foraging precision increases the benefit gained from growth in heterogeneous soil. Our understanding of the impacts of plant foraging precision and soil heterogeneity on plants and communities is less advanced than commonly believed, and we suggest several areas in which further research is needed."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In Chilean evergreen temperate forest, fern species of the genus Blechnum occur in diverse microhabitats ranging from large gaps to heavily shaded understoreys. We hypothesised that differences in the ecological breadth of three co-occurring Blechnum species would be associated with differences in magnitude of ecophysiological responses to light availability. We quantified the field distribution of each species in relation to diffuse light availability (% canopy openness), and measured in situ variation in photosynthetic capacity (A), dark respiration (R (d)) and specific leaf area (SLA) across the light gradient. The response of SLA of each species was also evaluated in a common garden in two light conditions (understorey and forest edge). The three Blechnum species differed significantly in the range of light environments occupied (breadth: B. chilense > B. hastatum > B. mochaenum). Despite significant interspecific differences in average A and R (d), the response of these traits to light availability did not differ among species. However, there was significant interspecific variation in both the mean value and the plasticity of SLA to light availability, the species with least ecological breadth (B. mochaenum) showing a flatter reaction norm (lower response) than its two congeners. This pattern was also found in the common garden experiment. The adjustment of leaf morphology (SLA) to light availability appears to be an important mechanism of acclimation in these Blechnum species. The narrow range of light environments occupied by B. mochaenum may be at least partly attributable to its inability to display phenotypic plasticity in SLA to changes in light availability."

 "AbstractText": "Few studies of phenotypic selection have focused on physiological traits, especially in natural populations. The adaptive significance of plant water-use efficiency, the ratio of photosynthesis to water loss through transpiration, has rarely been examined. In this study, carbon isotopic discrimination, Delta, an integrated measure of water-use efficiency, was repeatedly measured in juveniles and adults in a natural population of the herbaceous desert perennial Cryptantha flava over a 4-year period and examined for plasticity in Delta, consistency between years in values of Delta, and evidence for selection on Delta phenotypes. There was significant concordance in Delta values among the 4 years for adult plants and significant correlations in Delta values measured in different years for juveniles and adults combined. The wettest year of the study, 1998, proved an exception because Delta values that year were not correlated with Delta values in any other year of the study. Consistency in Delta measured on the same plants in different years could indicate genotypic variation and/or consistency in the water status of the microhabitats the plants occupied. Two forms of plasticity in Delta were also evident; mean seasonal values were correlated with precipitation the preceding autumn, and Delta values also declined with plant size, indicating increasing water-use efficiency. Phenotypic selection was evident because in the first year of the study juvenile plants that would survive until year five averaged lower Delta values than did those that failed to survive. During the driest year, 2000, Delta was significantly negatively correlated with adult plant size, measured as the number of leaf rosettes, but the negative relationship between Delta and the number of flowering stalks, a more direct measure of fitness, was not significant. These results suggest that the direction of phenotypic selection on Delta changes as plants grow."

"ArticleTitle": "Induced resistance in the indeterminate growth of aspen (Populus tremuloides).",
"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Studies of induction in trees have examined rapid induced resistance (RIR) or delayed induced resistance (DIR), but have not examined induction that occurs in leaves produced by indeterminately growing trees subsequent to, but in the same season as, damage. We refer to induction that occurs during this time period as intermediate-delayed induced resistance (IDIR). We assessed the influences of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, on temporal and spatial variation in induction and on tradeoffs between induced and constitutive levels of resistance in indeterminately growing saplings of aspen (Populus tremuloides). We utilized a common garden of 12 aspen genotypes experiencing two levels of defoliation and two levels of soil nutrients. We assessed concentrations of phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins in damaged leaf remnants collected 1 week after defoliation to examine rapid and local induction, and in undamaged leaves produced 8 weeks after defoliation to assess intermediate-delayed and systemic induction. In general, tannins showed RIR, while phenolic glycosides expressed IDIR. For both classes of allelochemicals, we found high estimates of broad-sense heritability and genetic variation in both induced and constitutive levels. Genetic variation may be maintained by both direct costs of allelochemicals and by costs of inducibility (phenotypic plasticity). Such costs may drive the tradeoff exhibited between induced and constitutive levels of phenolic glycosides. IDIR may be important in reducing total-season tissue loss by providing augmented resistance against late summer herbivores in trees that have experienced damage earlier in the season. Herbivore-resistant compensatory growth is especially beneficial to young trees growing in competitive environments."

 "AbstractText": "Nitrogen fertilization induces dramatic changes in the growth and development of plants, including forest trees. In this study we examined short-term responses of hybrid poplar, Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa x deltoides, to N fertilization. Glasshouse-grown saplings subjected to limiting, intermediate, and luxuriant levels of ammonium nitrate over a 28 d time course demonstrated rapid changes to whole-plant architecture and biomass accumulation. Nitrogen-associated shifts in allocation occurred in temporally distinct stages. Nitrogen availability modulated parameters that affect carbon gain, including light-saturated net photosynthesis and leaf area. These parameters were affected by N-induced changes to leaf maturation and senescence. Leaf area was also affected by N-induced sylleptic branch development. Genes encoding vegetative storage proteins and starch biosynthetic enzymes exhibited contrasting patterns of expression under differential N availability. A gene encoding a previously uncharacterized putative pectin methylesterase inhibitor displayed expression patterns comparable to the starch biosynthetic genes. The results of this study illustrate the phenotypic plasticity that P. balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa x deltoides exhibits in response to differential N availability."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Shade tolerance, plastic phenotypic response to light and sensitivity to photoinhibition were studied in holly (Ilex aquifolium L.) seedlings transported from the field to a greenhouse and in adult trees in the field. All plants were growing in, or originated from, continental Mediterranean sites in central Spain. Seedlings tolerated moderate but not deep shade. Mortality was high and growth reduced in 1% sunlight. Survival was maximal in 12% sunlight and minimal in full sunlight, although the relative growth rate of the seedlings surviving in high light was similar to that of plants in moderate shade. Maximum photochemical efficiency at predawn was significantly lower in sun plants than in shade plants in the field, revealing chronic photoinhibition that was most pronounced in winter. Plasticity in response to available light varied according to the variable studied, being low for photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance, and high for specific leaf area, root:shoot ratio and leaf area ratio, particularly in seedlings. Differences in water relations and hydraulic features between sun and shade plants in the field were marginal. High water potential at the turgor loss point of field-grown plants suggested that holly is sensitive to drought during both the seedling and the adult stage. Low relative growth rates in both high and low light with low physiological plasticity in response to light indicate the existence of a stress-tolerance mechanism. We conclude that holly is a facultative understory plant in areas of oceanic and relatively mild climate, but an obligate understory plant in dry continental areas such as the study site. The impact of abandonment of traditional management practices and climate change on these Mediterranean populations is discussed."

 "AbstractText": "We explore the relationships among phenotypic plasticity, parental effects, and parental care in plants by presenting data from four experiments examining reflectance/color patterns in Plantago lanceolata. In three experiments, we measured spike (inflorescence) reflectance between 362 and 850 nm using a spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Experiments show that (1) spike reflectance changes seasonally within and outside the visible portion of the spectrum of radiant energy, (2) increasing ambient temperature causes an individual plant to produce flowering and fruiting spikes that reflect more/lighten in color (the greatest changes occur in the regions around 550 nm and between 750 and 850 nm, the visible and near-infrared regions, respectively), (3) responses are reversible, (4) genotypes within populations and populations from different latitudes differ in mean reflectance and degree of phenotypic plasticity. In a fourth experiment, we measured internal spike temperature. Darker spikes, those produced at lower temperature, got hotter than did lighter spikes in full sun. Thus, plants can partially thermoregulate reproduction and the embryonic development of their offspring. In light of a previous experiment, data suggest that thermoregulation produces adaptive parental effects and is a mechanism by which P. lanceolata provides parental care."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Plant invasions often involve rapid evolutionary change. Founder effects, hybridization, and adaptation to novel environments cause genetic differentiation between native and introduced populations and may contribute to the success of invaders. An influential idea in this context has been the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis. It proposes that after enemy release plants rapidly evolve to be less defended but more competitive, thereby increasing plant vigour in introduced populations. To detect evolutionary change in invaders, comparative studies of native versus introduced populations are needed. Here, we review the current empirical evidence from: (1) comparisons of phenotypic variation in natural populations; (2) comparisons of molecular variation with neutral genetic markers; (3) comparisons of quantitative genetic variation in a common environment; and (4) comparisons of phenotypic plasticity across different environments. Field data suggest that increased vigour and reduced herbivory are common in introduced plant populations. In molecular studies, the genetic diversity of introduced populations was not consistently different from that of native populations. Multiple introductions of invasive plants appear to be the rule rather than the exception. In tests of the EICA hypothesis in a common environment, several found increased growth or decreased resistance in introduced populations. However, few provided a full test of the EICA hypothesis by addressing growth and defence in the same species. Overall, there is reasonable empirical evidence to suggest that genetic differentiation through rapid evolutionary change is important in plant invasions. We discuss conceptual and methodological issues associated with cross-continental comparisons and make recommendations for future research. When testing for EICA, greater emphasis should be put on competitive ability and plant tolerance. Moreover, it is important to address evolutionary change in characteristics other than defence and growth that could play a role in plant invasions."

 "AbstractText": "Thigmomorphogenesis refers to the widespread ability of sessile organisms to modify their morphology in response to a variety of mechanical stimulations, from direct contact with the stem by insects or other plants to flexure caused by wind, water, or snow. In this paper we investigated the differences in the reaction norms to wind exposure of seven species of the Brassicaceae that constitute a well-studied complex of known phylogenetic relationships. The goals included the characterization of differences between allopolyploids and their parental species and the comparison of wild and fast-cycling accessions within each species. We found statistically significant variation for plasticity among species or accessions for several characters, but the majority of the phenotypic variance was accounted for by overall (across-environment) differences among species and accessions and not by variation in plasticity. Allopolyploids displayed an array of behaviors when compared to their parents, from co-dominance to complete dominance to exceeding both parental means. Furthermore, fast-cycling plants showed distinct features from their wild relatives, suggesting that wild populations should be included with artificially selected lines in ecological studies. We proposed further steps to gain a more comprehensive understanding of thigmomorphogenetic responses, by integrating current research on the molecular bases of thigmomorphogenesis with insights into the ecology and evolution of plants exposed to wind."

 "AbstractText": "This paper compares the flexibility in the nexus between phenotype and genotype in plants and animals. These taxa although considered to be fundamentally different are found to be surprisingly similar in the mechanisms used to achieve plasticity. Although non-cognitive behaviour occurs in plants, its range is limited, while morphological and developmental plasticity also occur to a considerable extent in animals. Yet both plants and animals are subject to unique constraints and thus need to find unique solutions to functional problems. A true comparison between the plant and animal phenotype would be a comparison between plants and sessile photosynthesizing colonial invertebrates. Such comparisons are lacking. However, they would provide important insights into the adaptive significance of plasticity in these groups. It is also suggested that a comparison of inflexible traits in these groups would provide an understanding of the constraints, as well as the costs and benefits,of a plastic versus non-plastic phenotype in plants and animals."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity is an important response mechanism of plants to environmental heterogeneity. Here, we explored the genetic basis of plastic responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to water deficit by experimentally mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in two recombinant inbred populations (Cvi x Ler and Ler x Col). We detected genetic variation and significant genotype-by-environment interactions for many traits related to water use. We also mapped 26 QTL, including six for carbon isotope composition (delta13C). Negative genetic correlations between fruit length and fruit production as well as between flowering time and branch production were corroborated by QTL colocalization, suggesting these correlations are due to pleiotropy or physical linkage. Water-limited plants were more apically dominant with greater root:shoot ratios and higher delta13C (higher water-use efficiency) when compared to well-watered plants. Many of the QTL effects for these traits interacted significantly with the irrigation treatment, suggesting that the observed phenotypic plasticity is genetically based. We specifically searched for epistatic (QTL-QTL) interactions using a two-dimensional genome scan, which allowed us to detect epistasis regardless of additive genetic effects. We found several significant QTL-QTL interactions including three that exhibited environmental dependence. These results provide preliminary evidence for proposed genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "We compared plastic responses to variation in the light environment for sympatric populations of native and exotic dandelion species, Taraxacum ceratophorum and Taraxacum officinale. Plasticity in leaf size, inflorescence height, reproductive phenology and dispersal-related traits were measured under experimentally altered light quality (red : far-red light ratio, R : FR) and light intensity (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR). To test whether differences in means and reaction norms of dispersal-related traits between species affected colonization potential, we created seed-dispersal models based on seed-fall rate and release height. Differences in plasticity between species were not systematic, but varied in direction and magnitude among traits. Taraxacum officinale produced larger leaves that exhibited greater plasticity in size under variable light intensity than T. ceratophorum. Plasticity in scape length at flowering occurred in relation to R : FR ratio in both species, but tended to be greater in T. ceratophorum. Seed-bearing scapes of T. officinale were taller and more canalized in height across light regimes than scapes of T. ceratophorum. Seeds of T. officinale were smaller than seeds of T. ceratophorum. Models predict greater dispersal in T. officinale within open and vegetated habitats. In contrast to the idea that plasticity promotes invasiveness, results suggest that the lack of plasticity in dispersal-related traits enhances the colonization potential of T. officinale.",

A very different question is whether phenotypic plasticity causes evolution or is a major evolutionary mechanism. Existing models of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity cover many of the proposals in the literature about the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution. I will extend existing models to cover adaptation to a novel environment, the appearance of ecotypes and possible covariation between phenotypic plasticity and mean trait value of ecotypes. Genetic assimilation does not sufficiently explain details of observed patterns. Phenotypic plasticity as a major mechanism for evolution--such as, invading new niches, speciation or macroevolution--has, at present, neither empirical nor model support.",

 "AbstractText": "In outcrossing plants, seed dispersal distance is often less than pollen movement. If the scale of environmental heterogeneity within a population is greater than typical seed dispersal distances but less than pollen movement, an individual's environment will be similar to that of its mother but not necessarily its father. Under these conditions, environmental maternal effects may evolve as a source of adaptive plasticity between generations, enhancing offspring fitness in the environment that they are likely to experience. This idea is illustrated using Campanula americana, an herb that grows in understory and light-gap habitats. Estimates of seed dispersal suggest that offspring typically experience the same light environment as their mother. In a field experiment testing the effect of open vs understory maternal light environments, maternal light directly influenced offspring germination rate and season, and indirectly affected germination season by altering maternal flowering time. Results to date indicate that these maternal effects are adaptive; further experimental tests are ongoing. Evaluating maternal environmental effects in an ecological context demonstrates that they may provide phenotypic adaptation to local environmental conditions.",

 "AbstractText": "The ability of an organism to alter the environment that it experiences has been termed 'niche construction'. Plants have several ways whereby they can determine the environment to which they are exposed at different life stages. This paper discusses three of these: plasticity in dispersal, flowering timing and germination timing. It reviews pathways through which niche construction alters evolutionary and ecological trajectories by altering the selective environment to which organisms are exposed, the phenotypic expression of plastic characters, and the expression of genetic variation. It provides examples whereby niche construction creates positive or negative feedbacks between phenotypes and environments, which in turn cause novel evolutionary constraints and novel life-history expression.",

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Based on empirical evidence from the literature we propose that, in nature, phenotypic plasticity in plants is usually expressed at a subindividual level. While reaction norms (i.e. the type and the degree of plant responses to environmental variation) are a property of genotypes, they are expressed at the level of modular subunits in most plants. We thus contend that phenotypic plasticity is not a whole-plant response, but a property of individual meristems, leaves, branches and roots, triggered by local environmental conditions. Communication and behavioural integration of interconnected modules can change the local responses in different ways: it may enhance or diminish local plastic effects, thereby increasing or decreasing the differences between integrated modules exposed to different conditions. Modular integration can also induce qualitatively different responses, which are not expressed if all modules experience the same conditions. We propose that the response of a plant to its environment is the sum of all modular responses to their local conditions plus all interaction effects that are due to integration. The local response rules to environmental variation, and the modular interaction rules may be seen as evolving traits targeted by natural selection. Following this notion, whole-plant reaction norms are an integrative by-product of modular plasticity, which has far-reaching methodological, ecological and evolutionary implications.",

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The high potential fitness benefit of phenotypic plasticity tempts us to expect phenotypic plasticity as a frequent adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. Examples of proven adaptive plasticity in plants, however, are scarce and most plastic responses actually may be 'passive' rather than adaptive. This suggests that frequently requirements for the evolution of adaptive plasticity are not met or that such evolution is impeded by constraints. Here we outline requirements and potential constraints for the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, identify open questions, and propose new research approaches. Important open questions concern the genetic background of plasticity, genetic variation in plasticity, selection for plasticity in natural habitats, and the nature and occurrence of costs and limits of plasticity. Especially promising tools to address these questions are selection gradient analysis, meta-analysis of studies on genotype-by-environment interactions, QTL analysis, cDNA-microarray scanning and quantitative PCR to quantify gene expression, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to quantify protein expression. Studying plasticity along the pathway from gene expression to the phenotype and its relationship with fitness will help us to better understand why adaptive plasticity is not more universal, and to more realistically predict the evolution of plastic responses to environmental change.",

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "2399-418" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Over evolutionary history, conifers have faced a myriad of threats from phloem- and xylem-feeding insects, defoliating insects, and fungal pathogens. Among the trees' defenses, terpenoids appear to play a major role by harming, disabling, deterring, repelling, or otherwise reducing the fitness of potential invaders. Each of the three classes of terpenoids in conifers, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, are composed of a large number of representative compounds. In most cases, the presence of a particular terpenoid compound in the oleoresin or volatile emissions from a specific conifer can be accounted for by the expression of one of many committed terpene synthase (TPS) genes. However, while each TPS may produce one or a few major products, many produce a variety of minor products with relatively constant component ratios in the product blends. TPS genes exist in conifers in large and functionally diverse, yet monophyletic, gene families. Within these gene families, new biochemical functions of TPS appear to have evolved by gene duplication and changes in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme's active site. In addition, TPS genes may be differentially expressed prior to, during, and following attack by insects or pathogens. Thus, while the production of any particular terpenoid is hardwired into a conifer's genome, these trees have the capacity to change the mixture of terpenoids in oleoresin secretions and volatile emissions. Anatomical changes may also accompany induced terpenoid production, supplementing the plasticity of the molecular and biochemical events."

 "AbstractText": "Reflectance indices are frequently used for the nondestructive assessment of leaf chemistry, especially pigment content, in environmental or developmental studies. Since reflectance spectra are influenced by trichome density, and trichome density displays a considerable phenotypic plasticity, we asked whether this structural parameter could be a source of variation in the values of the most commonly used indices. Trichome density was manipulated in detached leaves of three species having either peltate (Olea europaea and Elaeagnus angustifolius) or tubular (Populus alba) trichomes by successive removal of hairs. After each dehairing step, trichome density was determined by light or scanning electron microscopy and reflectance spectra were obtained with a diode-array spectrometer. Although species-specific differences were evident, most of the indices were considerably affected even at low trichome densities. In general, the less-affected indices were those using wavebands within the visible spectral region. The index that could be safely used even at very high hair densities in all species was the red edge index (lambda(RE)) for chlorophyll. The results indicate that changes in reflectance indices should be interpreted cautiously when concurrent changes in trichome density are suspected. In this case, the red edge for chlorophyll content may be the index of choice."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "If phenotypic plasticity is under genetic control, it may vary in amount and pattern on a geographical scale, e.g. among different regions of a species' distribution. It may also differ between large and small or between less and more isolated populations, due to differences in genetic diversity. In a 2-year common garden study, the responses of several traits to drought and fertilizer treatments were studied in the grassland herb Carlina vulgaris. Individuals originating from populations of different size and degree of isolation in six European countries, representing \"central\" and \"marginal\" regions, were compared. Fertilizing had a negative effect on early plant survival, as well as on flowering probability in surviving plants. However, in those plants that flowered, fertilizing strongly increased mean number of flowerheads, flowerhead area (a correlate of seed number), and seed mass. Drought had generally weaker effects but enhanced survivorship, indicating that this treatment was closer to optimal conditions than were non-drought conditions. For some traits there were significant interactions of region x fertilizer, but the geographical pattern of reaction norms was inconsistent and lent no support to the hypothesis that central and marginal populations differ in overall plasticity. Population size and isolation had hardly any influence on treatment responses, but populations within regions differed in their mean response to fertilizing with regard to survival and flowering probabilities, as well as in their response to drought with regard to survival and total flowerhead area. It is concluded that response to raised nutrient levels is highly variable within populations, ranging from death to strongly increased reproductive output, but also among populations irrespective of size or isolation. This also goes for the response to water supply, though this variation shows a more unclear pattern. There is no evidence that small or isolated/marginal populations are less plastic than large or non-isolated/central populations, and the explanation for differences in treatment responses among plant populations should be sought in other population characteristics."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "2645-56" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "On exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV), many plant species both reduce stem elongation and increase production of phenolic compounds that absorb in the UV region of the spectrum. To demonstrate that such developmental plasticity to UV is adaptive, it is necessary to show that the induced phenotype is both beneficial in inductive environments and maladaptive in non-inductive environments. We measured selection on stem elongation and phenolic content of seedlings of Impatiens capensis transplanted into ambient-UV and UV-removal treatments. We extended the range of phenotypes expressed, and thus the opportunity for selection in each UV treatment, by pretreating seedlings with either a low ratio of red:far-red wavelengths (R:FR), which induced stem elongation and reduced phenolic concentrations, or high R:FR, which had the opposite effect on these two phenotypic traits. Reduced stem length relative to biomass was advantageous for elongated plants under ambient UV, whereas increased elongation was favored in the UV-removal treatment. Selection favored an increase in the level of phenolics induced by UV in the ambient-UV treatment, but a decrease in phenolics in the absence of UV. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that reduced elongation and increased phenolic concentrations serve a UV-protective function and provide the first explicit demonstration in a wild species that plasticity of these traits to UV is adaptive. The observed cost to phenolics in the absence of UV may explain why many species plastically upregulate phenolic production when exposed to UV, rather than evolve constitutively high levels of these compounds. Finally, pretreatment with low R:FR simulating foliar shade did not exacerbate the fitness impact of UV exposure when plants had several weeks to acclimate to UV. This observation suggests that the evolution of adaptive shade avoidance responses to low R:FR in crowded stands will not be constrained by increased sensitivity to UV in elongated plants when they overtop their neighbors."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Geographic variation is characteristic of many physiological traits at the population and species levels. However, several recent studies have suggested that population-level variation is either limited or that it is mostly a consequence of phenotypic plasticity. Here we show that there is considerable physiological inertia in cold hardiness, upper thermal tolerance limits and desiccation resistance in caterpillars of the sub-Antarctic moth Embryonopsis halticella Eaton, such that populations from two climatically different islands are physiologically very similar. Both populations are moderately chill tolerant, with no difference in the supercooling points of caterpillars (-17 to -20 degrees C). Within their host plants caterpillars of both populations freeze at substantially higher, and statistically equivalent temperatures (-9.5 to -11.5 degrees C). The populations also have similar upper lethal limits (38 degrees C), and survival times of dry conditions (6-170 h depending on mass). The previously inexplicably low freezing point of caterpillars at the climatically less severe Marion Island seems likely a consequence of physiological inertia given that the freezing point of caterpillars within their hosts is only a few degrees below absolute minima at the older, and colder, Heard Island. Lack of adaptive geographic variation in physiological traits has consequences for models of range limits, and highlights the importance of exploring phenotypic plasticity as a response to climatic variation."

 "AbstractText": "The essential cellular functions of the molecular chaperone HSP90 have been intensively investigated in fungal and mammalian model systems. Several recent publications have highlighted the importance of this chaperone complex in plant development and responsiveness to external stimuli. In particular, HSP90 is crucial for R-protein-mediated defense against pathogens. Other facets of HSP90 function in plants include its involvement in phenotypic plasticity, developmental stability, and buffering of genetic variation. Plants have emerged as powerful tools that complement other model systems in attempts to extend our knowledge of the myriad impacts of protein folding and chaperone function."

 "AbstractText": "Competition and herbivory are ubiquitous environmental challenges that affect most plants. We examined the influence of phenotypic responses to either competition or herbivory on the subsequent response of the plants to the other factor. The stem-elongation response of Chenopodium album to light competition attenuated its resistance to caterpillar herbivory in terms of herbivore mortality, but not in terms of growth of the survivors. Plant responses to herbivory did not affect subsequent responses to light competition. Thus, plants were largely able to express phenotypic plasticity (a proportional increase in the phenotype) following previous exposure to a different environmental factor. Although plants were able to express sequential plasticity, the final phenotype expressed was limited by exposure to previous environmental factors: induced resistance reduced plant height and stem elongation made plants more palatable to herbivores. Phenotypic plasticity in response to competition and herbivory may thus limit the subsequent expression of adaptive phenotypes."

 "AbstractText": "Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) composed of Galpha, Gbeta, and Ggamma subunits are important transducers of hormonal signals in organisms as evolutionarily distant as plants and humans. The genomes of diploid angiosperms, such as that of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, encode only single canonical Galpha and Gbeta subunits, only two identified Ggamma subunits, and just one regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein. However, a wide range of processes-including seed germination, shoot and root growth, and stomatal regulation-are altered in Arabidopsis and rice plants with mutations in G protein components. Such mutants exhibit altered responsiveness to a number of plant hormones, including gibberellins, brassinosteroids, abscisic acid, and auxin. This review describes possible mechanisms by which such pleiotropic effects are generated and considers possible explanations for why G protein component mutations in plants fail to be lethal. A possible role of G protein signaling in the control of phenotypic plasticity, a hallmark of plant growth, is also discussed."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Effects of maternal environment on offspring performance have been documented frequently in herbivorous insects. Despite this, very few cases exist in which exposure of parent insects to a resource causes the phenotype of their offspring to be adjusted in a manner that is adaptive for that resource, a phenomenon called adaptive transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. I performed a two-generation reciprocal cross-transplant experiment in the field with the soft scale insect Saissetia coffeae (Hemiptera: Coccidae) on two disparate host plant species in order to separate genetic effects from possible transgenerational plasticity. Despite striking differences in quality between host species, maternal host had no effect on overall offspring performance, and I detected no \"acclimatization\" to the maternal host species. However, there was a significant negative association between maternal and offspring development times, with potentially adaptive implications. Furthermore, offspring of mothers reared in an environment where scale densities were higher and scales were more frequently killed by fungi were significantly less likely to suffer from fungal attack than were offspring of mothers reared in an environment where densities were low and fungal attack was rare. Although S. coffeae does not appear to alter offspring phenotype to increase offspring fitness on these two distinct plant species, it does appear that offspring phenotype may be responding to some subtler aspects of maternal environment. In particular, the possibility of induced transgenerational prophylaxis in S. coffeae deserves further investigation."

 "AbstractText": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the variability of physiological performances of Castanea sativa Mill. in relation to drought tolerance, among and within European populations coming from contrasting environmental conditions. Forty-eight open-pollinated families from a stratified sample (temperature/precipitation) of six naturalized populations from Spain, Italy and Greece were grown for one growth period under two temperature regimes (25 and 32 degrees C), in combination with two watering regimes in growth chambers. Complementary to growth traits analysed in a previous study, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), a complex physiological trait involved in acclimation and adaptive processes, was studied. anova indicated significant Delta variability for C. sativa populations across Europe and, thereby, variation in adaptedness to drought. The European pattern of Delta variability matches the previously reported one for the centre of origin of C. sativa (Ponto-Caucasian region). This suggests that common mechanisms of drought adaptedness, involving both genetic and physiological determinants, give C. sativa the capacity to colonize a wide range of site conditions. The highest Delta values, indicating the lowest water-use efficiency (WUE), were found within each treatment for populations originating from Mediterranean drought-prone sites. These populations also had the highest phenotypic plasticity of Delta. Significant among-family genetic variation in Delta was found. The heritability based on the joint anova was estimated at 0.31 +/- 0.07. The estimates of the coefficients for the additive variance varied in the range 2.6-4.0%, suggesting possibilities for selection on WUE and adaptedness to drought. The genetic correlations between Delta and growth traits were generally strong and negative, especially in the two high temperature treatments."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Taking into account the individual growth form (allometry) in a plant population and the effects of intraspecific competition on allometry under the population self-thinning condition, and adopting Ogawa's allometric equation 1/y = 1/axb + 1/c as the expression of complex allometry, the generalized model describing the change mode of r (the self-thinning exponential in the self-thinning equation, log M = K + log N, where M is mean plant mass, K is constant, and N is population density) was constructed. Meanwhile, with reference to the changing process of population density to survival curve type B, the exponential, r, was calculated using the software MATHEMATICA 4.0. The results of the numerical simulation show that (1) the value of the self-thinning exponential, r, is mainly determined by allometric parameters; it is most sensitive to change of b of the three allometric parameters, and a and c take second place; (2) the exponential, r, changes continuously from about -3 to the asymptote -1; the slope of -3/2 is a transient value in the population self-thinning process; (3) it is not a 'law' that the slope of the self-thinning trajectory equals or approaches -3/2, and the long-running dispute in ecological research over whether or not the exponential, r, equals -3/2 is meaningless. So future studies on the plant self-thinning process should focus on investigating how plant neighbor competition affects the phenotypic plasticity of plant individuals, what the relationship between the allometry mode and the self-thinning trajectory of plant population is and, in the light of evolution, how plants have adapted to competition pressure by plastic individual growth."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The microalgae genus Scenedesmus is commonly found in freshwater bodies, wastewater facilities and water polluted with heavy metals. Phenotypic plasticity in Scenedesmus has been documented in response to a wide variety of conditions; however, heavy metals have not been comprehensively documented as phenotypic plasticity inducers. In this study, we report the phenotypic plasticity of Scenedesmus incrassatulus (a non-spiny, four-cell coenobium forming species) in response to EC(50) value of copper, cadmium and hexavalent chromium. S. incrassatulus was grown in batch cultures in the presence of each metal. Chlorophyll-a content, cell size, parameters derived from the schematic energy-flux model for photosystem II, and morphotype expressions were recorded. Divalent cation metals induced unicellular forms, and hexavalent chromium produced out-of-shape coenobia corresponding to various stages of autospore formation. The changes induced by divalent metals were interpreted as phenotypic plasticity, because they were always associated to population doublings and were reversible when toxicant pressure was removed (only for Cu). Copper was the best inductor of unicellular forms and also affected significantly all the photosynthetic parameters measured. The developed morphotypes could confer ecological advantages to S. incrassatulus in metal stressed environments."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Transgenerational phenotypic changes, whereby offspring have an altered trait or a distinct alternate phenotype, frequently occur in response to increased maternal predation risk. The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii (Glover), is unique, however, as offspring consist of four distinct phenotypes (\"normal\" light green apterae, \"normal\" dark green apterae, \"dwarf\" yellow apterae, and alatae), all with divergent life history patterns and resulting population dynamics. Here, we show that increased predation risk induces transgenerational phenotypic changes in cotton aphids. When exposed to search tracks from larval or adult convergent ladybird beetles, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, cotton aphids produced greater numbers of winged offspring. In a subsequent experiment, apterous and alate individuals on clean plants were found to have primarily normal and dwarf offspring, respectively. We suggest that elevated predation risk may cause phenotypic changes in aphids over multiple generations, resulting in a more precipitous decline in herbivore populations than could be explained solely by increased predation rates."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Plasticity of the phenotypic architecture of wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum, was studied in response to water and nutrient stress. Direct and indirect selection on several vegetative and reproductive traits was estimated and path analysis used to reveal how regulating pathways via maternal investment differed between environments. Vegetative traits displayed differential regulating effect on fitness across experimental environments: (1) increase in size was selected for under optimal conditions and under water stress, but not under nutrient stress; (2) allocation to root biomass was selected for under optimal conditions, but it had no effect under nutrient stress and was strongly selected against when water was limiting; (3) delayed onset of reproduction was selected under nutrient limitation whereas earlier onset was selected under water stress. The regulating effect of reproductive traits on final reproductive output also differed across treatments, operating either at the 'early' stage of plant development through varying the number of initiated spikelets per spike (no stress and water stress treatment) or at the 'late' developmental stage adjusting the fertile spikelet weight (no stress and nutrient stress treatment). Reproductive output was regulated via seed abortion under no stress and water stress treatments. Although the underlying mechanism of the regulation through abortion has yet to be discovered, the specific mechanism of abortion under water stress appears to be different from that under optimal conditions. Our results demonstrate that not only is the character architecture in wild barley plastic and sensitive to changing availability of water and nutrients, but the regulating mechanism of maternal investment is also environmentally sensitive."

 "AbstractText": "Ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) seedlings were grown in the field under three levels of natural light: (1) open, (2) gap and (3) shade. Light acclimation of photosynthesis was characterized by means of modulated chlorophyll a fluorescence of intact leaves and growth parameters were measured at the end of the growing season. Measurements of maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of dark-adapted leaves at intervals through the day showed that ash had a higher Fv/Fm than beech in open and gap plots but not in shade plots. This indicated a larger build-up of photoinhibition in beech under gap and open conditions. Steady-state light response curves of the operating efficiency of PSII (F'q/F'm), the electron transport rate (ETR) and the photochemical efficiency factor (F'q/F'v) showed greater variability across light treatments in ash than in beech. Both species exhibited similar responses of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) to light. When the data were normalized to the mean maximum irradiance in the growth environment, all photochemical parameters showed a reduction in variation across treatments, indicating that light acclimation in the two species occurred primarily through adjustments in rates of photochemistry. Adjustments in thermal heat dissipation were small in both species. This pattern was stronger in ash, suggesting a greater degree of phenotypic plasticity in photosynthetic capacity in this earlier successional species. Contrary to our expectations, the build-up of photoinhibition in beech did not appear to have a negative effect on total biomass accumulation relative to ash."

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "BACKGROUND AND SCOPE: Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) as an ecophysiological modification of photosynthetic carbon acquisition has been reviewed extensively before. Cell biology, enzymology and the flow of carbon along various pathways and through various cellular compartments have been well documented and discussed. The present attempt at reviewing CAM once again tries to use a different approach, considering a wide range of inputs, receivers and outputs. INPUT: Input is given by a network of environmental parameters. Six major ones, CO(2), H(2)O, light, temperature, nutrients and salinity, are considered in detail, which allows discussion of the effects of these factors, and combinations thereof, at the individual plant level ('physiological aut-ecology'). RECEIVERS: Receivers of the environmental cues are the plant types genotypes and phenotypes, the latter including morphotypes and physiotypes. CAM genotypes largely remain 'black boxes', and research endeavours of genomics, producing mutants and following molecular phylogeny, are just beginning. There is no special development of CAM morphotypes except for a strong tendency for leaf or stem succulence with large cells with big vacuoles and often, but not always, special water storage tissues. Various CAM physiotypes with differing degrees of CAM expression are well characterized. OUTPUT: Output is the shaping of habitats, ecosystems and communities by CAM. A number of systems are briefly surveyed, namely aquatic systems, deserts, salinas, savannas, restingas, various types of forests, inselbergs and paramós. CONCLUSIONS: While quantitative census data for CAM diversity and biomass are largely missing, intuition suggests that the larger CAM domains are those systems which are governed by a network of interacting stress factors requiring versatile responses and not systems where a single stress factor strongly prevails. CAM is noted to be a strategy for variable, flexible and plastic niche occupation rather than lush productivity. 'Physiological syn-ecology' reveals that phenotypic plasticity constitutes the ecophysiological advantage of CAM."

 "AbstractText": "Stomatal characteristics and its plasticity in leaves of four canopy species, Shorea chinensis, Pometia tomentosa, Anthocephalus chinensis, Calophyllun polyanthum and three middle-layer species, Barringtonia pendula, Garcinia hanburyi, Horsfieldia tetratepala acclimated to different light conditions (8%, 25%, 50% and 100% of full sunlight) for more than one year were surveyed. All plant's stomata were distributed on the abaxial of leaves. Pometia tomentosa and Barringtonia pendula had higher stomatal density, and the guard cell length of Anthocephalus chinensis and Calophyllun polyanthum were much greater than others'. Stomatal density and stomatal index (ratio of stomatal numbers to epidermal cell number) were increased with growth irradiance increased, while numbers of stomata per leaf were higher in the low than the high relative PFD, and stomatal conductance of leaves was the highest in the 50% of sunlight except for Anthocephalus chinensis. The relative PFD had little effects on the guard cell length of all seven plants. There was a significant negative correlation between stomatal density and leaf area, but the stomatal conductance was not significantly positive with the stomatal conductance in some degree. The analysis of phenotypic plasticity of stomatal characteristics showed that plasticity index for stomatal index and numbers of stomatal per leaf were similar for canopy and middle-layer species, while the plasticity index of stomatal density and stomatal conductance were significantly greater for canopy species than middle-layer species. The high plasticity of canopy species was consistent with the hypothesis that specialization in a more favorable environment increases plasticity."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "587-98" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), dark CO2 uptake is mediated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), an enzyme that can be regulated at transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Reversible phosphorylation of PEPC is catalyzed by a dedicated PEPC kinase, which in turn is regulated at the transcriptional level over the 24-h cycle in CAM plants. PEPC kinase controls the day/night regulation of PEPC during the CAM cycle, thus facilitating plasticity for optimizing CO2 uptake under different environmental conditions. To understand the importance of PEPC kinase in relation to its target PEPC in terms of CAM performance, the expression of the genes encoding the two enzymes was investigated in four species of Clusia that have photosynthetic patterns ranging from C3 photosynthesis to constitutive CAM. By linking changes in the expression of PEPC and PEPC kinase to day/night patterns of leaf gas exchange, organic acid, and soluble sugar contents under different environmental conditions, the genetic and metabolic limitations to CAM plasticity were assessed. The results indicate that PEPC expression is a major factor underpinning the genotypic capacity for CAM and that PEPC kinase expression does not appear to limit CAM. The day/night regulation of Ppck transcript abundance was found to be a consequence of CAM and the day/night cycling of associated metabolites, rather than the primary controlling factor for the temporal separation of carboxylation processes."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Flowering time, the major regulatory transition of plant sequential development, is modulated by multiple endogenous and environmental factors. By phenotypic profiling of 80 early flowering mutants of Arabidopsis, we examine how mutational reduction of floral repression is associated with changes in phenotypic plasticity and stability. Flowering time measurements in mutants reveal deviations from the linear relationship between the number of leaves and number of days to bolting described for natural accessions and late flowering mutants. The deviations correspond to relative early bolting and relative late bolting phenotypes. Only a minority of mutants presents no detectable phenotypic variation. Mutants are characterized by a broad release of morphological pleiotropy under short days, with leaf characters being most variable. They also exhibit changes in phenotypic plasticity across environments for florigenic-related responses, including the reaction to light and dark, photoperiodic behavior, and Suc sensitivity. Morphological pleiotropy and plasticity modifications are differentially distributed among mutants, resulting in a large diversity of multiple phenotypic changes. The pleiotropic effects observed may indicate that floral repression defects are linked to global developmental perturbations. This first, to our knowledge, extensive characterization of phenotypic variation in early flowering mutants correlates with the reports that most factors recruited in floral repression at the molecular genetic level correspond to ubiquitous regulators. We discuss the importance of functional ubiquity for floral repression with respect to robustness and flexibility of network biological systems."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity of relative growth rate (RGR), its components and associated morphological traits was studied in relation to nutrient limitation. In all, 140 F(3) lines from a cross, made between two Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) accessions sampled in Israel, were subjected to growth analysis under two nutrient levels. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for RGR and three of its components, leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area and leaf mass fraction (LMF). Indications for close linkage (potential pleiotropy) were found, for example, for LAR and LMF. An interesting case is on chromosome 6, at which QTLs for RGR and seed mass were detected in the same region. These QTLs had opposite additive effects, supporting earlier results that plants growing from lighter seeds had a higher RGR. Only two QTLs were significant under both nutrient conditions, suggesting large QTL x environment interactions for most traits. For 21 out of 26 QTLs, however, the additive genetic effect was of identical sign in both nutrient environments, but reached the significance threshold in only one of them. Nevertheless, some QTLs detected in one of the two environments had virtually no effect in the other, and QTLs for plasticity were detected for RGR, LAR and LMF, as well as for some morphological traits. QTLs with opposite effects under high and low nutrients were not found. Thus, at the genetic level, there was no evidence for a trade-off between faster growth at high versus low nutrient levels."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The endangered medicinal herb, Changium smyrnioides can only be found in deciduous forest gaps within the middle to northern subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest zone of China. The considerable plasticity of its shoot and root structure helps it to capture light more effectively in winter and early spring, and to adapt to the soil moisture conditions in its narrow habitat. Another medicinal plant, Anthriscus sylvestris, is of similar economic importance but commonly dis-tributed widely. In contrast to C. smyrnioides, it has low structural plasticity. It is also specialized to adapt to the moist and sunny environment, where habitat, such as the banks of creeks and rivers, is abundant."

 "AbstractText": "Both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity might be expected to affect the location of geographic range limits. Co-gradient variation (CoGV), plasticity that is congruent with genetic differentiation, may enhance performance at range margins, whereas its opposite, counter-gradient variation (CnGV) may hinder performance. Here we report findings of reciprocal transplant experiments intended to tease apart the roles of differentiation and plasticity in producing phenotypic variation across a geographic border between two plant subspecies. Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. xantiana ssp. parviflora are California-endemic annuals that replace each other along a west-east gradient of declining precipitation. We analyzed variation in floral traits, phenological traits, and vegetative morphological and developmental traits by sowing seeds of 18 populations (six of ssp. xantiana and 12 of ssp. parviflora) at three sites (one in each subspecies' exclusive range and one in the subspecies' contact zone), in two growing seasons (an exceptionally wet El Niño winter and a much drier La Niña winter). Significant genetic differences between subspecies appeared in 11 of 12 traits, and differences were of the same sign as in nature. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that selection is responsible for subspecies differences. Geographic variation within subspecies over part of the spatial gradient mirrored between-subspecies differences present at a larger scale. All traits showed significant plasticity in response to spatial and temporal environmental variation. Plasticity patterns ranged from spatial and temporal CoGV (e.g., in node of first flower), to spatial CnGV (e.g., in flowering time), to patterns that were neither CoGV nor CnGV (the majority of traits). Instances of CoGV may reflect adaptive plasticity and may serve to increase performance under year-to-year environmental variation and at sites near the subspecies border. However, the presence of spatial CnGV in some critical traits suggests that subspecies ranges may also be constrained by patterns of plasticity."

 "text": "GREENLAB is presented, a mathematical plant model that simulates interactions between plant structure and function. Dual-scale automaton is used to simulate plant organogenesis from germination to maturity on the basis of organogenetic growth cycles that have constant thermal time. Plant fresh biomass production is computed from transpiration, assuming transpiration efficiency to be constant and atmospheric demand to be the driving force, under non-limiting water supply. The fresh biomass is then distributed among expanding organs according to their relative demand. Demand for organ growth is estimated from allometric relationships (e.g. leaf surface to weight ratios) and kinetics of potential growth rate for each organ type. These are obtained through parameter optimization against empirical, morphological data sets by running the model in inverted mode. Potential growth rates are then used as estimates of relative sink strength in the model. These and other 'hidden' plant parameters are calibrated using the non-linear, least-square method.",

 "AbstractText": "In high altitude plants, flowering quickly ensures reproductive success within a short snow-free period, but limits maturation time and fecundity. Natural selection on prefloration intervals may therefore vary in contrasting snowmelt environments and could influence the outcome of phenological responses to climatic change. This study investigated adaptive differentiation and plasticity of prefloration intervals in the subalpine perennial Potentilla pulcherrima. Three years of in situ field observations were combined with phenotypic selection analyses and a common garden experiment. Plants from high, intermediate, and low altitudes expressed similar prefloration intervals and plasticity when grown at common altitude, indicating no evidence for adaptive differentiation. Selection on the prefloration interval was negative at both low and high altitudes before and after accounting for strong positive selection on size. Environmental differences between high and low altitudes indicated that long, dry seasons and short, wet seasons both favored rapid reproduction. Therefore, quicker reproduction was adaptive in response to late snowmelt, but slower reproduction in response to earlier snowmelt appeared to be maladaptive. Selection differed marginally between late snowmelt years and dry ones. Plastic responses to future precipitation patterns may therefore have positive or negative effects on fitness within a single species, depending upon altitude and year."

 "AbstractText": "Plant competition for light is a commonly occurring phenomenon in natural and agricultural vegetations. It is typically size-asymmetric, meaning that slightly larger individuals receive a disproportionate share of the light, leaving a limited amount of light for the initially smaller individuals. As a result, size inequalities of such stands increase with competition intensity. A plant's ability to respond morphologically to the presence of neighbour plants with enhanced shoot elongation, the so-called shade avoidance response, acts against the development of size inequalities. This has been shown experimentally with transgenic plants that cannot sense neighbours and, therefore, show no shade avoidance responses. Stands of such transgenic plants showed a much stronger development of size inequalities at high plant densities than did wild type (WT) stands. However, the transgenic plants used in these experiments displayed severely hampered growth rates and virtually no response to neighbours. In order to more precisely study the impact of this phenotypic plasticity on size inequality development, experiments required plants that have normal growth rates and reduced, but not absent, shade avoidance responses. We made use of an ethylene-insensitive, transgenic tobacco genotype (Tetr) that has wild type growth rates and moderately reduced shade avoidance responses to neighbours. Here, we show that the development of size inequalities in monocultures of these plants is not affected unambiguously different from wild type monocultures. Plots of Tetr plants developed higher inequalities for stem length than did WT, but monocultures of the two genotypes had identical CV (Coefficient of Variance) values for shoot biomass that increased with plant density. Therefore, even though reduced shade avoidance capacities led to the expected higher size inequalities for stem length, this does not necessarily lead to increased size inequalities for shoot biomass."

 "AbstractText": "Environmental variation in temperature can have dramatic effects on plant morphology, phenology, and fitness, and for this reason it is important to understand the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature. We investigated constraints on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in response to a temperature gradient in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by applying modern analytical tools to the classic data of Westerman & Lawrence (1970). We found significant evidence for two types of constraints. First, we detected numerous significant genetic correlations between plastic responses to temperature and the mean value of a trait across all environments, which differed qualitatively in pattern between the set of ecotypes and the set of mutant lines in the original sample. Secondly, we detected significant costs of flowering time plasticity in two of the three experimental environments, and a net pattern of selection against flowering time plasticity in the experiment overall. Thus, when explored with contemporary methods, the prescient work of Westerman & Lawrence (1970) provides new insights about evolutionary constraints on the evolution of plasticity."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "83-93" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The fruit fly Tephritis bardanae infests flower heads of two burdock hosts, Arctium tomentosum and A. minus. Observations suggest host-associated mating and behavioural differences at oviposition indicating host-race status. Previously, flies from each host plant were found to differ slightly in allozyme allele frequencies, but these differences could as well be explained by geographical separation of host plants. In the present study, we explicitly test whether genetic and morphological variance among T. bardanae are explained best by host-plant association or by geographical location, and if this pattern is stable over a 10-year period. Populations of A. tomentosum flies differed significantly from those of A. minus flies in (i) allozyme allele frequencies at the loci Pep-A and Pgd, (ii) mtDNA haplotype frequencies and (iii) wing size. In contrast, geographical location had no significant influence on the variance estimates. While it remains uncertain whether morphometric differentiation reflects genotypic variability or phenotypic plasticity, allozyme and mtDNA differentiation is genetically determined. This provides strong evidence for host-race formation in T. bardanae. However, the levels of differentiation are relatively low indicating that the system is in an early stage of divergence. This might be due to a lack of time (i.e. the host shift occurred recently) or due to relatively high gene flow preventing much differentiation at loci not experiencing selection."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The growth-differentiation balance hypothesis (GDB), which postulates a physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation (morphological and chemical), has been tested almost exclusively for carbon-based secondary metabolites. Little attention has been paid to N-based compounds. In this study we aimed to test the predictions of the GDB hypothesis under field conditions for growth and pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) formation in Senecio vulgaris. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment at two sites differing widely in their nutrient supply. These included a conventionally managed vineyard (V) and a strip of local wild flowers between crop fields, which was established to promote species diversity in agroecosystems (C). No fertilizer or pesticides are allowed in such ecological compensation areas. In C, we expected lower growth but higher PA formation than in V. Due to differentiated selection regimes in the two habitat types with regard to nutrient (nitrogen) availability in the soil, we also expected different N-allocation patterns for the genotypes of the two collection sites. Plants of V produced more biomass and were taller than the plants of C. The relatively poor nitrogen conditions in C favored an earlier differentiation towards generative organs. In plants of C, higher concentrations of PAs were found than in plants of V. There exists a close negative correlation between growth and PA formation, indicating a trade-off. The origin of the plant material had only a little effect on PA formation. The observed phenotypic reaction of PA formation in S. vulgaris in the two habitats fits quite well the predictions of GDB theory. It is shown that this general response is overlaid by physiological factors leading to a pattern of PA accumulation, which is not readily predictable by nonmechanistic theories."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Lateral root formation, the primary way plants increase their root mass, displays developmental plasticity in response to environmental changes. The aberrant lateral root formation (alf)4-1 mutation blocks the initiation of lateral roots, thus greatly altering root system architecture. We have positionally cloned the ALF4 gene and have further characterized its phenotype. The encoded ALF4 protein is conserved among plants and has no similarities to proteins from other kingdoms. The gene is present in a single copy in Arabidopsis. Using translational reporters for ALF4 gene expression, we have determined that the ALF4 protein is nuclear localized and that the gene is expressed in most plant tissues; however, ALF4 expression and ALF4's subcellular location are not regulated by auxin. These findings taken together with further genetic and phenotypic characterization of the alf4-1 mutant suggest that ALF4 functions independent from auxin signaling and instead functions in maintaining the pericycle in the mitotically competent state needed for lateral root formation. Our results provide genetic evidence that the pericycle shares properties with meristems and that this tissue plays a central role in creating the developmental plasticity needed for root system development."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "We tested the hypothesis that the tropical shrub Clidemia hirta appears more shade tolerant and is more abundant in its introduced than native range because of genetic differences in resource acquisition, allocation, and phenotypic plasticity between native and introduced genotypes. We examined growth, biomass allocation, and photosynthetic parameters of C. hirta grown in a greenhouse from seed collected from four populations in part of its native range (Costa Rica) and four populations in part of its introduced range (Hawaiian Islands). Six-month-old seedlings were placed in high (10.3-13.9 mol m(-2) day(-1)) or low (1.4-4.5 mol m(-2) day(-1)) light treatments and grown for an additional 6 months. Our study provided little evidence that Hawaiian genotypes of C. hirta differed genetically from Costa Rican genotypes in ways that would contribute to differences in habitat distribution or abundance. Some of the genetic differences that were apparent, such as greater allocation to stems and leaf area relative to whole plant biomass in Costa Rican genotypes and greater allocation to roots in Hawaiian genotypes, were contrary to predictions that genotypes from the introduced range would allocate more biomass to growth and less to storage than those from the native range. Hawaiian and Costa Rican genotypes displayed no significant differences in relative growth rates, maximal photosynthetic rates, or specific leaf areas in either light treatment. In the high light environment, however, Hawaiian genotypes allocated more biomass to reproductive parts than Costa Rican genotypes. Phenotypic plasticity for only 1 of 12 morphological and photosynthetic variables was greater for Hawaiian than Costa Rican genotypes. We conclude that genetic shifts in resource use, resource allocation, or plasticity do not contribute to differences in habitat distribution and abundance between the native and introduced ranges of C. hirta."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "An optimization model is presented that examines the relationship between root architecture and multiple resource acquisition, specifically water and phosphorus in spatially heterogeneous environments. The basal root growth angle of an individual common bean plant, which determines the orientation and localization of the bulk of the root system, was modeled as the decision variable. The total payoff to the plant, the benefit obtained from water and phosphorus acquisition, minus the costs of spatial competition between roots, is given as a function of the (x,y) coordinates of the basal root in two-dimensional Cartesian space. We obtained a general solution and applied it to four unique environmental cases which are as follows: (1) the case of uniformly distributed water and phosphorus; (2) the case of localized shallow phosphorus; (3) the case of localized deep water; and (4) the case of shallow phosphorus and deep water. The general solution states that the optimal basal root growth angle will occur at the point where the total rate of change in the value of the resources acquired equals the total rate of change in cost that results from locating the root deeper in the soil. An optimizing plant locates its roots deeper in the soil profile until the marginal benefit exactly equals the marginal cost. The model predicts that the basal root angle of an optimizing plant will be shallower for Case 2 and deeper for Case 3, relative to the basal root angle obtained in the case of uniformly distributed water and phosphorus. The optimal basal root angle for Case 4 will depend on the marginal rate of substitution of water availability for phosphorus availability that occurs with depth. Empirical observations of bean root architecture in the greenhouse and in the field confirm model results and are discussed. In addition, the potential importance of phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic variation are discussed in relation to optimization of traits and adaptation to spatially heterogeneous environments."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Plants possess a remarkable capacity to alter their phenotype in response to the highly heterogeneous light conditions they commonly encounter in natural environments. In the present study with the weedy annual plant Sinapis arvensis, we (a) tested for the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity in morphological and life history traits in response to low light and (b) explored possible fitness costs of plasticity. Replicates of 31 half-sib families were grown individually in the greenhouse under full light and under low light (40% of ambient) imposed by neutral shade cloth. Low light resulted in a large increase in hypocotyl length and specific leaf area (SLA), a reduction in juvenile biomass and a delayed onset of flowering. Phenotypic selection analysis within each light environment revealed that selection favoured large SLA under low light, but not under high light, suggesting that the observed increase in SLA was adaptive. In contrast, plasticity in the other traits measured was maladaptive (i.e. in the opposite direction to that favoured by selection in the low light environment). We detected significant additive genetic variance in plasticity in most phenotypic traits and in fitness (number of seeds). Using genotypic selection gradient analysis, we found that families with high plasticity in SLA had a lower fitness than families with low plasticity, when the effect of SLA on fitness was statistically kept constant. This indicates that plasticity in SLA incurred a direct fitness cost. However, a cost of plasticity was only expressed under low light, but not under high light. Thus, models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity will need to incorporate plasticity costs that vary in magnitude depending on environmental conditions."

 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic plasticity and genotype-environment interactions (GEI) play a prominent role in plant morphological diversity and in the potential functional capacities of plant life-history traits. The genetic basis of plasticity and GEI, however, is poorly understood in most organisms. In this report, inflorescence development patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana were examined under different, ecologically relevant photoperiod environments for two recombinant inbred mapping populations (Ler x Col and Cvi x Ler) using a combination of quantitative genetics and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Plasticity and GEI were regularly observed for the majority of 13 inflorescence traits. These observations can be attributable (at least partly) to variable effects of specific QTL. Pooled across traits, 12/44 (27.3%) and 32/62 (51.6%) of QTL exhibited significant QTL x environment interactions in the Ler x Col and Cvi x Ler lines, respectively. These interactions were attributable to changes in magnitude of effect of QTL more often than to changes in rank order (sign) of effect. Multiple QTL x environment interactions (in Cvi x Ler) clustered in two genomic regions on chromosomes 1 and 5, indicating a disproportionate contribution of these regions to the phenotypic patterns observed. High-resolution mapping will be necessary to distinguish between the alternative explanations of pleiotropy and tight linkage among multiple genes."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Flax (Linum usitatissimum) has a genome in which changes have been associated with environmental factors. The inbred flax variety, Stormont Cirrus (Pl), served as the parent, and several lines (termed genotrophs) were derived from this parent. The phenotypes of the genotrophs were stable in a number of different growth environments, unlike the original Pl line in which changes associated with environmental factors continued to occur. These genotrophs differed from the original line in a number of characteristics, but the only known phenotypic characteristic that is shared by all the genotrophs and different from the parental, Pl, line is the lack of changes associated with the original environmental factors. However, some of these genotrophs have changed in both phenotype and nuclear DNA subsequent to their original growth and differentiation from Pl. Representational difference analysis (RDA) has been used to identify differences between Pl and all the genotrophs in an attempt to identify the loci controlling these aspects of plasticity. Subtractions between Pl DNA as a tester (target) and one of the genotrophs (individual RDA) or a mixture of different types of genotroph (L6, S6, C2, and LH) DNAs as a driver were done (combined sample RDA; csRDA). In addition, contrary RDA, where of the genotroph DNA was used as a tester and Pl DNA as a driver, was also executed. Three difference clones (163-4-2, 123-5-2, and 163-13), from 74 primary clones obtained after three rounds of subtractions with Pl DNA as tester were further characterized. In addition, 2 difference products (213-r1 and 213-r9) were characterized from contrary RDA. The clones 163-4-2 and 163-13 from the csRDA showed polymorphisms between Pl and all the genotrophs when PCR was done with primers derived from sequences of the clones, but only the clone 163-13 polymorphism was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Four of 5 clones (163-4-2, 123-5-2, 163-13 and 213-r9) that have been characterized appear to be associated with structural changes in the DNA. From the contrary csRDA, it was observed that no clones could be recovered from subtractions between a mixture of genotrophs as a tester and Pl as a driver, and several possible explanations have been proposed."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Many plants display a characteristic suite of developmental \"shade avoidance\" responses, such as stem elongation and accelerated reproduction, to the low ratio of red to far-red wavelengths (R:FR) reflected or transmitted from green vegetation. This R:FR cue of crowding and vegetation shade is perceived by the phytochrome family of photoreceptors. Phytochrome-mediated responses provide an ideal system for investigating the adaptive evolution of phenotypic plasticity in natural environments. The molecular and developmental mechanisms underlying shade avoidance responses are well studied, and testable ecological hypotheses exist for their adaptive significance. Experimental manipulation of phenotypes demonstrates that shade avoidance responses may be adaptive, resulting in phenotypes with high relative fitness in the environments that induce those phenotypes. The adaptive value of shade avoidance depends upon the competitive environment, resource availability, and the reliability of the R:FR cue for predicting the selective environment experienced by an induced phenotype. Comparative studies and a reciprocal transplant experiment with Impatiens capensis provide evidence of adaptive divergence in shade avoidance responses between woodland and clearing habitats, which may result from population differences in the frequency of selection on shade avoidance traits, as well as differences in the reliability of the R:FR cue. Recent rapid progress in elucidating phytochrome signaling pathways in the genetic model Arabidopsis thaliana and other species now provides the opportunity for studying how selection on shade avoidance traits in natural environments acts upon the molecular mechanisms underlying natural phenotypic variation."

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The hypothesis that the balance of trade-offs between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation in the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare will change when resource input is increased has been investigated experimentally. When the quality of food available was increased, by adding a mixture of litter from herbaceous dicotyledonous plants to a background low-quality food of dead grasses, survivorship was found to be the most phenotypically plastic trait, increasing by 168%. Growth rates increased by 99% but reproductive allocation by only 21%. In the field, members of a population from a site with more high-quality food grew more than twice as fast as those from a site where less high-quality food was available. The population from the site with higher food availability, contrary to predictions from the laboratory study, did not survive as well as that from the site with less available high-quality food. This may be because the site that is more favourable for growth has a more stressful physical environment due to much bigger temperature fluctuations, which are known to be an important cause of mortality in this species. When individuals from both populations were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, both the parental and F1 generations from the poor growth environment survived better than those from the good growth habitat. However, even when given an excess of high-quality food those from the poor growth environment continued to grow more slowly and had a lower reproductive allocation than those from the site with higher food availability. We conclude that microevolutionary changes may have occurred in the balance of resource allocation between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation, to favour higher survivorship during the longer prereproductive period at the site where growth to the threshold size for reproduction takes longer."

 "AbstractText": "Somatic cells of Armillaria gallica fruit bodies have been shown to possess different genotypes for molecular-marker and mating-type loci. Here we report experiments on six quantitative traits and demonstrate that somatic cells of fruit bodies possess almost as much genetic variation for growth rate and phenotypic plasticity as do spores, the products of meiosis. Genetically distinct somatic cells therefore have the potential to grow at different rates relative to one another during primordial fruit body formation. This may confer an advantage on all cell lines within a fruit body, not just those that happen to grow better under a particular set of conditions. To our knowledge, genetic variation for fitness-related traits that make up a single genetic individual has not been reported before."

 "AbstractText": "At the Wind River Canopy Crane Facility in southeastern Washington State, USA, we examined phenotypic variation between upper- and lower-canopy branches of old-growth Thuja plicata J. Donn ex D. Don (western red cedar). Lower-canopy branches were longer, sprouted fewer daughter branches per unit stem length and were more horizontal than upper-canopy branches. Thuja plicata holds its foliage in fronds, and these had less projected area per unit mass, measured by specific frond area, and less overlap, measured by silhouette to projected area ratio (SPARmax), in the lower canopy than in the upper canopy. The value of SPARmax, used as an indicator of sun and shade foliage in needle-bearing species, did not differ greatly between upper- and lower-canopy branches. We suggest that branching patterns, as well as frond structure, are important components of morphological plasticity in T. plicata. Our results imply that branches of old-growth T. plicata trees have a guerilla growth pattern, responding to changes in solar irradiance in a localized manner."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Male Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) release an aggregation pheromone consisting of a blend of two components, dominicalure 1 (D1) and Dominicalure 2 (D2). Pheromone from single insects, in different contexts, was collected and measured to determine if this signal is phenotypically plastic. Release rates were lowered when males were moved from maize grains to groundnut kernels or when moved from solitary occupation of maize grain to grain occupied by seven females. The pheromone release was increased again once these moves were reversed. The release of D1 was more affected than D2: thus, on groundnuts or in the presence of females, less pheromone was released and the proportion of D1 in the blend was lowered. Possible reasons for the modifications of the signal are discussed."

 "AbstractText": "Habitat degradation and loss can result in population decline and genetic erosion, limiting the ability of organisms to cope with environmental change, whether this is through evolutionary genetic response (requiring genetic variation) or through phenotypic plasticity (i.e., the ability of a given genotype to express a variable phenotype across environments). Here we address the question whether plants from small populations are less plastic or more susceptible to environmental stress than plants from large populations. We collected seed families from small (<100) versus large natural populations (>1,000 flowering plants) of the rare, endemic plant Cochlearia bavarica (Brassicaceae). We exposed the seedlings to a range of environments, created by manipulating water supply and light intensity in a 2 x 2 factorial design in the greenhouse. We monitored plant growth and survival for 300 days. Significant effects of offspring environment on offspring characters demonstrated that there is phenotypic plasticity in the responses to environmental stress in this species. Significant effects of population size group, but mainly of population identity within the population size groups, and of maternal plant identity within populations indicated variation due to genetic (plus potentially maternal) variation for offspring traits. The environment x maternal plant identity interaction was rarely significant, providing little evidence for genetically- (plus potentially maternally-) based variation in plasticity within populations. However, significant environment x population-size-group and environment x population-identity interactions suggested that populations differed in the amount of plasticity, the mean amount being smaller in small populations than in large populations. Whereas on day 210 the differences between small and large populations were largest in the environment in which plants grew biggest (i.e., under benign conditions), on day 270 the difference was largest in stressful environments. These results show that population size and population identity can affect growth and survival differently across environmental stress gradients. Moreover, these effects can themselves be modified by time-dependent variation in the interaction between plants and their environment."

 "AbstractText": "In this article, we compare the reaction norms to foliage shade (changes in light quality, spatially fine-grained environmental variation) and photoperiod (day length, spatially coarse-grained environmental variation) in several haplotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana from Scandinavia. We found that both across-environment means and phenotypic plasticities evolved continuously and very rapidly within this group. Both character means and trait plasticities were highly integrated, in part as predicted by the adaptive plasticity hypothesis for response to foliage shade (the so-called shade-avoidance syndrome). We found that a significant but small fraction of the variance in across-treatment trait means and plasticities in response to one environmental factor is explained by variation of the same traits in response to the other factor. Genetic relatedness based on chloroplast DNA sequence variation among haplotypes was not associated with variation in across-treatment character means or their plasticities, suggesting that evolution of these characters has occurred on a local geographic scale via reticulation (outcrossing) among maternal lines rather than by the differential survival of selfing lineages."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Different plant species and organs within a plant differ in their plastic response to light. These responses influence their performance and survival in relation to the light environment, which may range from full sunlight to deep shade. Plasticity, especially with regard to physiological features, is linked to a greater capacity to exploit high light and is usually low in shade-tolerant species. Among photosynthetic organs, green stems, which represent a large fraction of the total photosynthetic area of certain species, are hypothesized to be less capable of adjustment to light than leaves, because of biomechanical and hydraulic constraints. The response to light by leaves and stems of six species of leguminous, green-stemmed shrubs from dry and high-light environments was studied by growing seedlings in three light environments: deep shade, moderate shade and sun (3, 30 and 100 % of full sunlight, respectively). Survival in deep shade ranged from 2 % in Retama sphaerocarpa to 74 % in Ulex europaeus. Survival was maximal at moderate shade in all species, ranging from 80 to 98 %. The six species differed significantly in their ratio of leaf to total photosynthetic area, which influenced their light response. Survival in deep shade increased significantly with increasing ratio of leaf to total photosynthetic area, and decreased with increasing plasticity in net photosynthesis and dark respiration. Responses to light differed between stems and leaves within each species. Mean phenotypic plasticity for the variables leaf or stem specific mass, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll a/b ratio, and carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio of leaves, was inversely related to that of stems. Although mean plasticity of stems increased with the ratio of leaf to total photosynthetic area, the mean plasticity of leaves decreased. Shrubs with green stems and a low ratio of leaf to total photosynthetic area are expected to be restricted to well-lit habitats, at least during the seedling stage, owing to their inefficient light capture and the low plasticity of their stems."

 "AbstractText": "Trade-offs associated with maintaining herbivory resistance and herbivory tolerance are frequently inferred in plant life histories. Invasive success for many non-native plants is often attributed to novel resistance that repels native herbivores. Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum, Euphorbiaceae) is a non-native invader that threatens ecosystems throughout the southeastern United States, including imperiled coastal prairie regions. Low herbivore loads due to costly resistance are generally assumed to give Sapium a competitive advantage over native plants. We predicted that if Sapium experienced higher damage levels it would show significant decreases in growth and reduced ability to compete with native prairie vegetation. We conducted full-factorial, paired greenhouse and field experiments designed to assess the effects of simulated leaf herbivory on Sapium growth in the presence of prairie vegetation at different levels of light and nitrogen. Contrary to our expectations, neither low-intensity, chronic defoliation nor high-intensity, acute defoliation negatively affected Sapium seedlings in any resource combination in either experiment. These studies reveal that Sapium possesses considerable phenotypic plasticity, and herbivory tolerance is a newly appreciated trait that likely contributes to its invasive potential."

 "AbstractText": "A standard norm of reaction (NoR) is a graphical depiction of the phenotypic value of some trait of an individual genotype in a population as a function an environmental parameter. NoRs thus depict the phenotypic plasticity of a trait. The topological properties of NoRs for sets of different genotypes can be used to infer the presence of (nonlinear) genotype-environment interactions. Although it is clear that many NoRs are adaptive, it is not yet settled whether their evolutionary etiology should be explained by selection on the mean phenotypic trait values in different environments or whether there are specific genes conferring plasticity. If the second alternative is true, the NoR is itself an object of selection. Generalized NoRs depict plasticity at the level of populations or subspecies within a species, species within a genus, or taxa at higher levels. Historically, generalized NoRs have routinely been drawn though rarely explicitly recognized as such. Such generalized NoRs can be used to make evolutionary inferences at higher taxonomic levels in a way analogous to how standard NoRs are used for microevolutionary inferences."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Adult body size, one of the most important life-history components, varies strongly within and between Heliconius erato phyllis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) populations. This study determines if this variation is caused by geographical changes in host-plant used by the larval stage, whose reproductive parameters are influenced by female body size, with estimates of the corresponding heritability. The variation in adult body size was determined together with a survey of passion vine species (Passifloraceae) used by the larvae in seven localities in Rio Grande do Sul State: three located in the urban area of Porto Alegre and Triunfo Counties, two within Eucalyptus plantations (Barba Negra Forest, Barra do Ribeiro County, and Aguas Belas Experimental Station-Viamão County), one in a Myrtaceae Forest (Itapuã State Park-Itapuã County) and one in the Atlantic Rain Forest (Maquiné Experimental Station-Maquiné County). Effects of female body size on fecundity, egg size and egg viability were determined in an outdoor insectary. Size heritability was estimated by rearing in the laboratory offspring of individuals maintained in an insectary. The data showed that adults from populations where larvae feed only upon Passiflora suberosa are smaller than those that feed on Passiflora misera. The larvae prefer P. misera even when the dominant passion vine in a given place is P. suberosa. Fecundity increases linearly with the increase in size of females, but there is no size effect on egg size or viability. Size heritability is null for the adult size range occurring in the field. Thus, the geographical variation of H. erato phyllis adult size is primarily determined by the type, corresponding availability and quality of host-plants used by the larval stage. Within the natural size range of H. erato phyllis, the variation related to this character is not genetically based, thus being part of H. erato phyllis phenotypic plasticity."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in chemical defense is thought to play a major role in plant-herbivore interactions. We investigated genetic variation for inducibility of defensive traits in wild radish plants and asked if the evolution of induction is constrained by costs of phenotypic plasticity. In a greenhouse experiment using paternal half-sibling families, we show additive genetic variation for plasticity in glucosinolate concentration. Genetic variation for glucosinolates was not detected in undamaged plants, but was significant following herbivory by a specialist herbivore, Pieris rapae. On average, damaged plants had 55% higher concentrations of glucosinolates compared to controls. In addition, we found significant narrow-sense heritabilities for leaf size, trichome number, flowering phenology, and lifetime fruit production. In a second experiment, we found evidence of genetic variation in induced plant resistance to P. rapae. Although overall there was little evidence for genetic correlations between the defensive and life-history traits we measured, we show that more plastic families had lower fitness than less plastic families in the absence of herbivory (i.e., evidence for genetic costs of plasticity). Thus, there is genetic variation for induction of defense in wild radish, and the evolution of inducibility may be constrained by costs of plasticity."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Soviet Lysenkoism was the darkest period of modern science, and its main product--Michurinist biology--was a collection of absurd theories usually based on anecdotal observations or on a few badly designed experiments without proper controls and without any statistical evaluation of results. However, in the thirties and early forties, Lysenkoists also described (and misinterpreted) some interesting data and observations which could have been real and which might inspire modern biologists to construct testable hypotheses and suggest experiments that could extend our scientific knowledge. Here, I attempt to present an explanation in terms of modern biology of some of those phenomena, namely vegetative hybridization, wobbled heritability, heritability of environmentally induced adaptive modifications and effects of intravariety hybridization of self-fertilizing cultivars. The first two phenomena can be explained on the basis of visualization of hidden genetic and epigenetic polymorphism (originating from somatic mutations, somatic recombination and paramutations), the third phenomenon by the occurrence of intraindividual selection of somatic cell lines, and the fourth phenomenon by low heritability of phenotypic properties (and therefore also low capability to evolve) of outcrossing organisms (in comparison with self-fertilizing or asexual organisms), i.e., by a theory of frozen plasticity."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The evolution of warning coloration (aposematism) has been difficult to explain because rare conspicuous mutants should suffer a higher cost of discovery by predators relative to the cryptic majority, while at frequencies too low to facilitate predator aversion learning. Traditional models for the evolution of aposematism have assumed conspicuous prey phenotypes to be genetically determined and constitutive. By contrast, we have recently come to understand that warning coloration can be environmentally determined and mediated by local prey density, thereby reducing the initial costs of conspicuousness. The expression of density-dependent colour polyphenism is widespread among the insects and may provide an alternative pathway for the evolution of constitutive aposematic phenotypes in unpalatable prey by providing a protected intermediate stage. If density-dependent aposematism can function as an adaptive intermediate stage for the evolution of constitutive aposematic phenotypes, differential reaction norm evolution is predicted among related palatable and unpalatable prey populations. Here, I present empirical evidence that indicates that (i) the expression of density-dependent colour polyphenism has differentially evolved between palatable and unpalatable populations of the grasshopper Schistocerca emarginata (= lineata) (Orthoptera: Acrididae), and (ii) variation in plasticity between these populations is commensurate with the expected costs of conspicuousness."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Flood response is a crucial component of the life strategy of many plants, but it is seldom studied in non-flooded tolerant species, even though they may be subjected to stressful environmental conditions. Phenotypic plasticity in reaction to environmental stress affects the whole plant phenotype and can alter the character correlations that constitute the phenotypic architecture of the individual, yet few studies have investigated the lability of phenotypic integration to water regime. Moreover, little has been done to date to quantify the sort of selective pressures that different components of a plant's phenotype may be experiencing under contrasting water regimes. Genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity at the single-trait and multivariate levels were investigated in 47 accessions of the weedy plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the relationship of plastic characters to reproductive fitness was quantified. Results indicate that these plants tend to be highly genetically differentiated for all traits, in agreement with predictions made on the basis of environmental variation and mating system. Varied patterns of apparent selection under flooded and non-flooded conditions were also uncovered, suggesting trade-offs in allocation between roots and above-ground biomass, as well as between leaves and reproductive structures. While the major components of the plants' multivariate phenotypic architecture were not significantly affected by environmental changes, many of the details were different under flooded and non-flooded conditions."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The ability of a single genotype to generate different phenotypes in disparate environments is termed phenotypic plasticity, which reflects the interaction of genotype and environment on developmental processes. However, there is controversy over the definition of plasticity genes. The gene regulation model states that plasticity loci influence trait changes between environments without altering the means within a given environment. Alternatively, the allelic sensitivity model argues that plasticity evolves due to selection of phenotypic values expressed within particular environments; hence plasticity must be controlled by loci expressed within these environments. To identify genetic loci controlling phenotypic plasticity and address this controversy, we analyzed the plasticity of glucosinolate accumulation under methyl jasmonate (MeJa) treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found genetic variation influencing multiple MeJa signal transduction pathways. Analysis of MeJa responses in the Landsberg erecta x Columbia recombinant inbred lines identified a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate plastic MeJa responses. All significant plasticity QTL also impacted the mean trait value in at least one of the two \"control\" or \"MeJa\" environments, supporting the allelic sensitivity model. Additionally, we present an analysis of MeJa and salicylic acid cross-talk in glucosinolate regulation and describe the implications for glucosinolate physiology and functional understanding of Arabidopsis MeJa signal transduction."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "We used a spatially explicit simulation model to examine the relative importance of vegetative and sexual reproduction in Hieracium pilosella L. Based on an understanding of the complex life cycle of this species and on data from in situ population dynamics in a calcareous grassland in NW Switzerland, we simulated growth and the relative contribution of clonal reproduction by stolons and reproduction by seeds across a gradient of increasing soil fertility. Competition by a clonal grass resulted in nearly complete exclusion of H. pilosella from the more fertile part of the simulation plot. Under low soil fertility, when grass could not survive, H. pilosella largely persisted by vegetatively produced rosettes. This pattern of a sharp separation of both species was shifted slightly in favour of H. pilosella by introducing random disturbances. Only by adding: (1) long-distance seed dispersal, and (2) facilitation of seedling establishment in the vicinity of grass tussocks in vegetation gaps was a more realistic representation of field observations realised, with rosettes of H. pilosella grown from seeds occasionally distributed within dense grass vegetation. Phenotypic plasticity of stolon length was a decisive factor for the maintenance of H. pilosella populations. We conclude that a mixed strategy of clonal growth and reproduction by seeds in H. pilosella is necessary to maintain populations of this species in the presence of high interspecific competition and a shortage of open space."

 "AbstractText": "Experiments were carried out at IGER, Aberystwyth, UK to investigate traits of direct relevance to the processes of overwintering and spring growth in white clover (Trifolium repens L.). The plant material used was derived from baseline populations of the cultivar AberHerald and survivor populations generated after 2-3 years' growth in Germany (Kiel), Sweden (Uppsala) and Switzerland (Zürich). The aims of the experiments were to measure the level of genetic shift that had occurred in certain traits due to selection in the survivor populations by comparing these with the baseline population. The adaptive significance of traits was assessed by determining the extent to which stabilizing selection had operated to reduce levels of intra-population variation. Significant differences were found in the responses of leaf production to two temperature treatments in the survivor populations from Germany and Sweden compared with the Swiss and baseline material. Plants of the former two populations produced much more leaf than the others at the higher temperature, but leaf production rates at the lower temperature did not differ. As this experiment used cloned genotypes in the two treatments, the result suggests that a higher degree of phenotypic plasticity for this trait had been selected for in the German and Swedish populations. These populations also showed greater rates of regrowth of leaves from terminal buds exposed to sub-zero temperatures, but there were no differences between populations in levels of freezing tolerance, or in stolon carbohydrate content. Genetic shift occurred in the degree of unsaturation of stolon lipids, with all three survivor populations possessing higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids than the baseline. Stabilizing selection also operated on this trait in the survivor populations, suggesting that it is of adaptive significance in cool climates."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Both plants and animals respond to stress by using adaptations that help them evade, tolerate, or recover from stress. In a synthetic paper A. D. Bradshaw (1972) noted that basic biological differences between plants and animals will have diverse evolutionary consequences, including those influencing how they deal with stress. For instance, Bradshaw argued that animals, because they have relatively well-developed sensory and locomotor capacities, can often use behavior and movement to evade or ameliorate environmental stresses. In contrast, he predicted that plants will have to emphasize increased physiological tolerance or phenotypic plasticity, and also that plants should suffer stronger selection and show more marked differentiation along environmental gradients. Here we briefly review the importance of behavior in mitigating stress, the behavioral capacities of animals and plants, and examples of plant responses that are functionally similar to behaviors of animals. Next, we try to test some of Bradshaw's predictions. Unfortunately, critical data often proved non-comparable: plant and animal biologists often study different stressors (e.g., water versus heat) and measure different traits (photosynthesis versus locomotion). Nevertheless, we were able to test some of Bradshaw's predictions and some related ones of our own. As Bradshaw predicted, the phenology of plants is more responsive to climate shifts than is that of animals and the micro-distributions of non-mobile, intertidal invertebrates (\"plant\" equivalents) are more sensitive to temperature than are those of mobile invertebrates. However, mortality selection is actually weaker for plants than for animals. We hope that our review not only redraws attention to some fascinating issues Bradshaw raised, but also encourages additional tests of his predictions. Such tests should be informative."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "1463-73" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Polyamine involvement in root development at low temperature was studied in seedlings of Pringlea antiscorbutica R. Br. This unique endemic cruciferous species from the subantarctic zone is subjected to strong environmental constraints and shows high polyamine contents. In the present study, free polyamine levels were modified by inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis (D-arginine, difluoromethylornithine, cyclohexylammonium, and methylglyoxal-bis-guanylhydrazone) and variations of the endogenous pools were compared to changes in root growth. The arginine decarboxylase pathway, rather than that of ornithine decarboxylase, seemed to play a major role in polyamine synthesis in Pringlea antiscorbutica seedlings. Root, but not shoot, phenotypes were greatly affected by these treatments, which modified polyamine endogenous levels according to their expected effects. A positive correlation was found between agmatine level and growth rate of the primary root. Spermidine and spermine contents also showed positive correlations with primary root growth whereas the putrescine level showed neutral or negative effects on this trait. Free polyamines were therefore found to be differentially involved in the phenotypic plasticity of root architecture. A comparison of developmental effects and physiological concentrations suggested that agmatine and spermine in particular may play a significant role in the control of root development."

 "AbstractText": "The occurrence, activity and plasticity of the CAM pathway is described from an introductory viewpoint, framed by the use of the four \"Phases\" of CAM as comparative indicators of the interplay between environmental constraints and internal molecular and biochemical regulation. Having described a number of \"rules\" which seem to govern the CAM cycle and apply uniformly to most species, a number of key regulatory points can then be identified. These include temporal separation of carboxylases, based on the circadian expression of key genes and their control by metabolites. The role of a circadian oscillator and interplay between tonoplast and nuclear control are central to maintaining the CAM cycle. Control of reserve carbohydrates is often neglected, but the importance of daily partitioning (for growth and the subsequent night-time CAM activity) and use at night is shown to drive the CAM cycle. Finally, it is shown that the genotypic and phenotypic plasticity in patterns of CAM expression is mediated partly by environmental conditions and molecular signalling, but also by diffusive constraints in succulent tissues. A transformation system is now required to allow these key areas of control to be elucidated."

 "AbstractText": "Among the plants collected from the Pie de Vaca Formation of the Oligocene, of Tepexi de Rodríguez, Puebla, México are five plants of Anacardiaceae, Haplorhus medranoensis, Rhus toxicodendron, Rhus sp., Comocladia intermedia, and Pistacia marquezii represented by their leaves and/or leaflets. The past and present diversity and geographic distribution of one of these genera, Rhus, demonstrate its capability to adapt and diversify in a wide variety of environments. Leaf architecture characters of this taxon overlap with those of other genera in the family, suggesting a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. The presence in the Pie de Vaca Formation of a type of Pistacia with leaf architecture characters similar to those of Asian plants further supports a long history of exchange between low-latitude North America and Asia. Links between low-latitude North and South America and the Caribbean are suggested by the presence of Comocladia and Haplorhus. Whereas Comocladia highlights the long history of regional endemics in the area, Haplorhus, today an endemic monotypic genus of Peru, suggests exchange mechanisms between North and South America. The morphologic characters of these taxa, and those of Pseudosmodingium (Anacardiaceae), some Rosaceae, Leguminosae, and Berberidaceae, suggest that the Pie de Vaca community was established and evolved in harsh environmental conditions. The Pie de Vaca flora thus provides significant new insights into the biogeographic relationships of the low latitude vegetation of North America."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The phenotypic plasticity that plants display in response to changes in their nutrient supply requires the operation of both short- and long-range signalling pathways. Long-distance signals arising in the root can provide the shoot with an early warning of fluctuations in external nutrient concentrations, while signals in the reverse direction are needed to ensure that root physiology and development are integrated with the nutritional demands of the shoot. In this review, the focus is on recent advances in the understanding of these long-distance signalling pathways with an emphasis on nitrate nutrition, and a personal view of the key issues for future research is put forward."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Photosynthetic gas exchange, nitrogen- and water-use efficiency, leaf water potential and seasonal patterns of leaf production were studied in seven, dominant dry-forest species from the island of Lana'i, Hawaii, including the rapidly colonizing, non-native Schinus terebinthifolius (Raddi). We evaluated whether unique physiological characteristics of the invasive species explain its capacity to rapidly invade dry forests throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Apparent anomalies in stable carbon isotope data (delta13C) relative to other results led us to study effects of environmental conditions and physiological performance during leaf expansion on delta13C. Species that expanded all their foliage at the beginning of the wet season had more negative leaf delta13C values during the dry season than species with continuous leaf expansion. Among species, S. terebinthifolius had a strong seasonal pattern of leaf production and the most negative delta13C (-29 per thousand). With respect to almost every trait measured, S. terebinthifolius fell at an end of the range of values for the native species. Rapid growth of S. terebinthifolius in this ecosystem may be partially explained by its high maximum CO2 assimilation rates (15 micromol m-2 s-1), low leaf mass per area, high photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency per unit leaf mass or area and large decrease in stomatal conductance during the dry season. Relative to the native species, the invasive species exhibited striking phenotypic plasticity, including high rates of stem growth and water and CO2 uptake during the wet season, and maintenance of leaves and high leaf water potentials, as a result of reduced water loss, during the dry season, enabling it to utilize available resources effectively."

 "AbstractText": "Plant dormancy is a form of phenotypic plasticity that minimizes exposure to seasonally stressful conditions. We examined variation in summer dormancy in two highland and two lowland populations of the lilioid geophyte Burchardia umbellata to test the prediction that facultative dormancy is advantageous in habitats with variable summer conditions. Consistent with this prediction fewer highland plants than lowland plants became dormant under wet common garden conditions. Also, significant among-family variance occurred within highland but not lowland populations, indicating genetic differences among and within populations. Most lowland plants became dormant when exposed to wet or dry conditions (∼92%), indicating that dormancy was primarily obligate. In contrast, dormancy in highland plants increased from 44% under wet conditions to 93% under dry conditions, indicating that dormancy of some highland plants was facultative and induced by drought. Survival, growth, and flowering were reduced in lowland populations, and in dormant vs. nondormant highland plants, indicating costs of dormancy that could negate the advantages of dormancy under variable summer conditions. Summers in lowland populations are predictably hot and dry, favoring a phenotype that responds invariably to environmental cues that are correlated to future dry conditions. In highland populations, variable summer conditions probably maintain polymorphism in dormancy."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Plastic stem-elongation responses to the ratio of red:far-red (R:FR) wavelengths enable plants to match their phenotype to local competitive conditions. However, elongation responses early in the life history may occur at the cost of reduced plasticity later in the life history, because elongation influences both allocation patterns and structural integrity. A common-garden experiment was performed to test whether seedling responses to R:FR affect biomass allocation. biomass accumulation, and subsequent plasticity to the cue. Seedlings of Abutilon theophrasti were stimulated to elongate by low R:FR treatments, and subsequent growth and plasticity was compared with nonelongated individuals. Elongated seedlings were less responsive than nonelongated ones to a second bout of low R:FR. Thus, seedling plasticity to R:FR reduces subsequent responsiveness to this cue. This negative association across life-history stages suggests an important constraint on the evolution of plastic stem responses, because selection in A. theophrasti has previously been shown to favor increases in early elongation in combination with increased later elongation. The reduced responsiveness of elongated seedlings to R:FR appeared to result from a structural feedback mechanism, indicating that the opportunity cost of early responses may be lower in environments providing structural support."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "821-9" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Models for the evolution of plasticity predict that individuals having phenotypes induced by exposure to enemies should experience relatively low fitness when enemies are absent. However, costs of induced phenotypes have been difficult to find in both plants and animals, perhaps because costs are expressed at later stages in the life cycle. We searched for delayed costs of an induced defense in larvae of the water frog Rana ridibunda, which exhibits strong phenotypic responses to predators. Tadpoles grew to metamorphosis in outdoor artificial ponds, in either the presence or absence of Aeshna dragonfly larvae confined within cages. We collected metamorphs at forelimb emergence, estimated their development rate until tail resorption was complete, and measured their body and leg shape and hopping performance. Development rate through metamorphosis reflects the duration of a transitional period during which metamorphs are especially vulnerable to predators, and hopping performance may reflect ability to escape predators. Froglets from the dragonfly treatment lost mass through metamorphosis significantly faster than those from predator-free ponds, but they resorbed their tails at about the same rate, despite the fact that their tails were relatively large to begin with. Froglets developing from predator-induced tadpoles had shorter, more muscular legs, and hopped 5% longer distances (difference not significant). Therefore, producing an induced defense against insect predators during the tadpole stage did not exact a cost during or immediately after metamorphosis; if anything, tadpoles with the predator-induced phenotype gave rise to more vigorous froglets. These results focus attention on other costs of the induced phenotype, as well as alternative explanations for plasticity that do not rely on direct fitness trade-offs."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "We tested for adaptive differentiation between two natural populations of Impatiens capensis from sites known to differ in selection on plasticity to density. We also determined the degree to which plasticity to density within a site was correlated with plastic responses of experimental immigrants to foreign sites. Inbred lines, derived from natural populations in an open-canopy site and a woodland site, were planted reciprocally in both original sites at naturally occurring high densities and at low density. The density manipulation represents environmental variation typically experienced within the site of a given population, and the transplant manipulation represents environmental differences between sites of different populations. Internode elongation, meristem allocation, leaf length, flowering date, and total lifetime fitness were measured. Genotypes originating in the open site, where selection favored plasticity of first internode length and flowering time (Donohue et al. 2000a), were more plastic in those characters than genotypes originating from the woodland site, where plasticity was maladaptive. Therefore, these two populations appear to have responded to divergent selection on plasticity. Plasticity to density strongly resembled plasticity to site differences for many characters, suggesting that similar environmental factors elicit plasticity both to density and to overhead canopy. Thus, plasticity that evolved in response to density variation within a site influenced phenotypic expression in the foreign site. Plastic responses to site caused immigrants from foreign populations to resemble native genotypes more closely. In particular, immigrants from the open site converged toward the selectively favored early-flowering phenotype of native genotypes in the woodland site, thereby reducing potential fitness differences between foreign and native genotypes. However, because genotypes from the woods population were less plastic than genotypes from the sun population, phenotypic differences between populations were greatest in the open site at low density. Therefore, population differences in plasticity can cause genotypes from foreign populations to be more strongly selected against in some environments than in others. However, genetic constraints and limits to plasticity prevented complete convergence of immigrants to the native phenotype in any environment."

Recently, intensive study has shown that plants are plastic for a remarkable array of ecologically important traits, ranging from diverse aspects of morphology and physiology to anatomy, developmental and reproductive timing, breeding system, and offspring developmental patterns. Comparative, quantitative genetics and molecular approaches are leading to new insights into the adaptive nature of plasticity, its underlying mechanisms and its role in the ecological distribution and evolutionary diversification of plants."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Populations of Allium vineale commonly include individuals with very different allocation patterns to three modes of reproduction: sexual flowers, aerially produced asexual bulbils, and belowground asexual offsets. If selection is currently acting to maintain these different allocation patterns there must be a genetic basis for variation in allocation to these three reproductive modes. In addition, negative genetic correlations between reproductive traits would imply evolutionary trade-offs among reproductive strategies. We evaluated the heritability of these allocation patterns by growing 16 clones from a single population in the greenhouse at two levels of fertilization. Bulb mass and the mass and number of bulbils, offsets, and flowers were used as response variables, in addition to the proportion allocated to each reproductive mode. We found evidence of substantial heritable variation in allocation to sexual reproduction and in allocation within the two modes of asexual reproduction, indicating high sensitivity of these allocation patterns to natural selection. We also found evidence of strong negative genetic correlations between bulbil and flower traits, as well as between bulbil and offset traits, with one group of genotypes allocating greater resources to aerial asexual bulbils and the second group allocating more resources to belowground asexual offsets and aerial flowers. Phenotypic plasticity in allocation to above- vs. belowground asexual reproduction and sexual vs. asexual aerial reproduction was limited, indicating that plants are unlikely to change reproductive mode in response to nutrient availability. Together, then, we have demonstrated strong heritability for, and trade-offs in, the reproductive allocation patterns within this plant population."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Tolerance is the ability of plants to maintain fitness after experiencing herbivore damage. We investigated scarlet gilia tolerance to browsing in the framework of phenotypic plasticity using both an operational and candidate trait approach. Individuals from full-sib families were split into an artificial clipping treatment, a natural-damage treatment, or left as controls. We tested for genetic variation in tolerance by evaluating family x herbivory treatment interactions on fitness in a mixed model analysis of variance. In addition, we used selection analyses to assess the function of flowering phenology and compensatory regrowth (via branch production) as candidate tolerance traits. We found a strong detrimental fitness effect of browsing and considerable variation among sire half-sib families in levels of tolerance (25% to 63% of the fitness of controls). There was no evidence of overcompensation at either the population or family level and no additive genetic variation in operationally defined tolerance. Phenotypic selection analyses provide evidence that early flowering and compensatory regrowth function as tolerance characters. We found strong linear and correlational selection for early flowering and increased branch production for damaged plants and linear selection for apical dominance (reduced branchiness) and early flowering in control plants. Moreover, reduced phenological delay and increased plasticity in branch production were correlated with tolerance. We detected significant additive genetic variation in flowering phenology in both treatments and a positive genetic correlation between the phenology of control and damaged plants. We found significant additive genetic variation in branch production in undamaged and naturally damaged plants, but not in clipped plants. Damaged plants exhibited marginally significant additive genetic variance in fitness, although its heritability was very low (approximately 3.6%). We failed to find additive genetic variation in the fitness of control plants. Our results suggest that tolerance traits are under herbivore-imposed natural selection in this population, but that responses to selection are limited by available genetic variation and selective constraints."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The reliability of environmental cues and costs of a fixed phenotype are two factors determining whether selection favors phenotypic plasticity or environmental specialization. This study examines the relationship between these two factors and the evolution of plant competitive strategies (plastic vs. fixed morphologies). In natural plant populations, shifts in light quality associated with foliar shade reliably indicate the presence of neighbors. These cues mediate plastic stem-elongation responses that often increase competitive ability and access to light. Using experimental light treatments (full sun, neutral shade, and foliar shade), genetic differences among populations of Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) in average elongation and plasticity to foliar-shade cues were examined. Six populations, two from each of three site types (fields in continuous corn cultivation, fields undergoing corn-soy rotation, and weedy sites), were exposed to the light treatments at two stages in their life history. At the seedling stage, populations derived from cornfield sites exhibited higher, average elongation than populations from either rotating corn-soy fields or weedy areas. Because seedling elongation may delay shading of velvetleaf by corn, population differences may reflect adaptive responses to directional selection imposed by competitive conditions. However, the effects of simulated foliar shade on elongation were three times as great as the average population differences, and these comparatively higher levels of elongation were associated with an allocation cost. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity may limit the evolution of specialists; reliable environmental cues enable individuals to facultatively adopt highly elongated, costly phenotypes in crowded patches while avoiding the costs of that phenotype in less crowded microsites. At later life-history stages, populations experiencing competition with corn exhibited lower plasticity to light quality than populations derived from weedy areas. Elongation at later nodes is maladaptive in cornfields because velvetleaf is ultimately incapable of overtopping corn; individuals that elongate therefore experience the cost of allocating to stems but fail to improve leaf exposure. The decreased responsiveness of cornfield populations to light quality is consistent with theoretical predictions in which reduced plasticity is favored when environmental cues fail to mediate an adaptive response."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "416-24" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Populations of Chlamydomonas founded by single cells were cultured in chemostats for 50 days, representing about 125 generations. The mean and variance of division rate was measured daily by withdrawing cells from the effluent and culturing them for 24 h on filtered effluent medium solidified with agar. Mean fitness did not change during the period of culture, and the behavior of neutral markers indicated that no substitutions of novel beneficial mutations occurred. However, the variance of fitness increased markedly at about the same rate in two replicate populations. The standardized rate, or mutational heritability, was Vm/VE = 4-5 x 10(-3) per generation. This is substantially greater than most other estimates for characters closely correlated with fitness. Moreover, it seems difficult to reconcile with the absence of any change in mean fitness. We investigated the possibility that frequency-dependent selection was created by spatial heterogeneity within the culture vessel by testing cell populations with different phenotypes from the top, bottom, and surface of the chemostats. However, the differentiation of these populations seemed to be attributable to phenotypic plasticity, with no evidence that their characteristics were heritable. Finally, we report an experiment in which lines were selected for about 100 generations on solid or liquid medium. These lines became specifically adapted to the medium on which they were cultured, showing that liquid and solid media, even when chemically identical, provide different conditions of growth for Chlamydomonas. The genetic variance appearing in the cultures was therefore attributed to conditionally neutral mutations that were not expressed in the chemostat. This implies that rates of accumulation of mutational variance measured in the culture environment itself (where this can be done) may greatly underestimate the variation available for a response through selection to environmental change. Moreover, it suggests that chemostat populations may be more dynamic and more diverse than is usually thought."

 "AbstractText": "In the interspecific cross of Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides, unexpected simultaneous occurrence of diploid hybrids and triploid hybrids (with two alleles from the female parent and one from the male parent at each locus) led us to examine the evolutionary genetic significance of this phenomenon. As expected, leaf size and shape of the triploid progeny are closer to the female P. trichocarpa than male P. deltoides parent. Although the pure triploid progeny population did not have higher genetic variance in leaf traits than the pure diploid population, the former appears to hide much non-additive genetic variance and display strong genetic control over the phenotypic plasticity of leaf traits. It is suggested that the cryptic non-additive variance, especially epistasis, can be released when a population is disturbed by changes in the environment. A mixed diploid and triploid progeny population combines phenotypic and genetic characteristics of both pure hybrids and is considered to be of adaptive significance for populars to survive and evolve in a fluctuating environment. The significant effect due to general and specific combining ability differences at the population level suggests that the population divergence of these two species is under additive and non-additive genetic control."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Connectance, the level of linkage between organs, was measured in different lines of Sorghum bicolor during their reproductive development. It was compared with expression of characters, their level of variability and their heritability. A negative relationship is observed between connectance and heritability. Further results indicate that connectance does not simply introduce a noise factor in expression of a pre-existing information, but that it is directly involved in phenotypic expression and plasticity. Connectance appears as partly determined by the nature and dynamics of the network of relationships. It is concluded that the phenotype is not restricted to the deterministic expression of a pre-existing program, the genotype. Morphogenesis also involves another dimension, self-organized, which confers reliability, stability and adaptability to the developmental processes. The complex interactions between these two dimensions and their evolutionary consequences are discussed."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "402-11" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Trade-offs between acquisition capacities for aboveground and belowground resources were investigated by studying the phenotypic plasticity of leaf and root traits in response to different irradiance levels at low nutrient supply. Two congeneric grasses with contrasting light requirements, Dactylis glomerata and D. polygama, were used. The aim was to analyze phenotypic covariation in components of leaf area and root length in response to above- and belowground resource limitation and the consequences of this variation for resource acquisition and plant growth. At intermediate shading (30 and 20% of full sunlight) the plants were able to maintain their total root length, despite a strongly increased total leaf area and a reduced biomass allocation to roots. This was associated with an unaltered or slightly increased nutrient uptake and growth. At 5.5% relative irradiance, growth was severely reduced, especially in the shade-tolerant D. polygama. The results show that constraints on acquisition capacities for aboveground and belowground resources, caused by biomass allocation, may be alleviated by plasticity in other traits such as tissue-mass density and thickness of roots and leaves. The results also suggest different adaptive constraints for phenotypic plasticity and for genetically determined interspecific variation. Phenotypic plasticity tends to maximize resource acquisition and growth rate in the short term, whereas the higher tissue-mass density and the longer leaf life-span of shade-tolerant species indicate reduced loss rates as a more advantageous species-specific adaptation to shade in the long term."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Temporal variability in survivorship and reproduction is predicted to affect the evolution of life-history characters. Desert annual plants experience temporal variation in reproductive success that is largely caused by precipitation variability. We studied several populations of the desert annual Plantago insularis along a precipitation gradient. Whereas models of bet hedging in unpredictable environments generally predict one optimal germination fraction for a population, empirical studies have shown that environmental conditions during germination can cause a range of germination fractions to be expressed. In a 4-yr field study, we found that populations in historically more xeric environments had lower mean germination fractions, as is predicted by bet-hedging models. However, populations exhibited significant variation in germination among years. Two experimental studies measuring germination under several environment conditions were conducted to elucidate the source of this in situ variation. Germination fractions exhibited phenotypic plasticity in response to water availability and date within the season. Populations differed in their norms of reaction such that seeds from more xeric populations germinated under less restrictive conditions. A pattern of delayed germination consistent with among-year bet-hedging predictions arose in the field through the interaction of seed germinability and the distribution of environmental conditions during germination."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The ecological processes underlying locust swarm formation are poorly understood. Locust species exhibit phenotypic plasticity in numerous morphological, physiological and behavioural traits as their population density increases. These density-dependent changes are commonly assumed to be adaptations for migration under heterogeneous environmental conditions. Here we demonstrate that density-dependent nymphal colour change in the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera: Acrididae) results in warning coloration (aposematism) when the population density increases and locusts consume native, toxic host plants. Fringe-toed lizards (Acanthodactylus dumerili (Lacertidae)) developed aversions to high-density-reared (gregarious-phase) locusts fed Hyoscyamus muticus (Solanaceae). Lizards associated both olfactory and visual cues with locust unpalatability, but only gregarious-phase coloration was an effective visual warning signal. The lizards did not associate low rearing density coloration (solitarious phase) with locust toxicity. Predator learning of density-dependent warning coloration results in a marked decrease in predation on locusts and may directly contribute to outbreaks of this notorious pest."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "In annual plants, including amphicarpic annuals, variation in light availability can evoke phenotypic plasticity in multiple traits. We examined plasticity to light availability of vegetative and reproductive performance traits in Amphicarpaea bracteata (Fabaceae) by developing and evaluating three path-analysis models using data from a greenhouse study. To assess whether light availability altered the phenotypic integration of these performance traits, we examined the models' fit to data collected within a high- or a low-light treatment. We also examined whether a single model or alternate models were required to fit data from the two contrasting light treatments. Using our path-analysis approach, we also made comparisons among three population types: shade- and sun-native populations of the widespread variety A. bracteata var. bracteata and sun-native populations of the variety A. bracteata var. comosa. Although each type of population was somewhat distinctive in patterns of integration and in the plasticity of integration, patterns did not correspond to contrasting ecological affinity, i.e., shade- and sun-native population types or to genetic relatedness of the two varieties. Counter to the prediction that selection regimes involving variation in one or more environmental factor favor intermediate levels of integration, phenotypic integration in A. bracteata was very flexible, with plasticity occurring in a trait-by-trait manner. In particular, there was an inverse relationship between aerial and subterranean reproductive modes in low but not high light. Previous studies of amphicarpic annuals have not observed this type of environment-specific life history trade-off."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "One of the most promising directions in the study of phenotypic plasticity is its detailed analysis in organisms that are also well-studied in other aspects. Also, conclusions based on plasticity studies in environmental gradients that closely mimic natural variation are shown to be the most relevant. Following those directions, we conducted this study of phenotypic plasticity on the currently best available model system in flowering plants--Arabidopsis thaliana, and utilized one of the most common variations experienced in the wild--variation in density. Four Arabidopsis thaliana commonly used inbred lines (ecotypes) were grown in densities from one to seven plants per pot. Both phenotypic plasticity and its genetic variability were detected for almost all of 11 analyzed traits, with analyzed ecotypes responding strongly to density of just two plants per pot. Density had small effect on life history and moderate effect on size traits, while vegetative and reproductive traits responded strongly. Mortality of plants during the experiment was almost absent, showing that all densities corresponded to the medium density phase in which \"carrying capacity\" is not yet reached. Genetic variability for phenotypic plasticity was in most cases the result of profound deviation of only one ecotype from the response of others. In the case of reproductive output, however, G x E interaction was the result of greater between-ecotype variability at lower densities. If we reasonably assume that dense stands are more common in the wild, this difference between ecotypes (populations) closely resembles the cases of so-called potential variability within populations."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Species differences in patterns of phenotypic plasticity may be an important aspect of adaptive diversity. Plasticity for functionally important root traits was studied in inbred field lineages of Polygonum persicaria and P. cespitosum (Polygonaceae). Replicate seedlings were grown in plexiglass rhizotrons under a range of constant and temporally variable moisture treatments. Plasticity was determined for final whole-plant biomass, root biomass allocation, and absolute and proportional root length. The dynamic aspect of root plasticity was examined by digitizing weekly tracings of the proportional deployment of each plant's root system to different vertical soil layers. Plants of both species expressed significant functionally adaptive phenotypic plasticity in the relative allocation, length, and vertical deployment of root systems in response to contrasting moisture conditions. Plasticity patterns in these closely related species were in general qualitatively similar, but for most traits differed in the magnitude and/or the timing of the plastic response. Dynamic changes in root deployment were more marked as well as faster in P. persicaria. Species differences in patterns of individual plasticity were generally consistent with the broader ecological distribution of P. persicaria in diverse as well as temporally variable moisture habitats."

"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "482-94" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Phenotypic variation in 11 floral and reproductive traits was studied in cloned plants of Campanula rapunculoides replicated in three discrete environments. Using an ANOVA approach, we determined the relative influence of genotype (G), environment (E), G × E interaction, and ontogeny (position on the raceme) on the 11 traits. Two traits, duration of flowering and pollen size, showed no significant variation. All nine remaining traits had significant genotypic variation, accounting for 21-38% of the total phenotypic variation. Correlations among variant traits in seven genotypes were predominantly positive, but several significant correlations in one environment changed sign or were nonsignificant in another environment. Ovule number was negatively correlated with most male function traits: the negative correlation between ovule and pollen number was particularly strong and consistent across environments. Six traits varied significantly across environments, including number of flowers, number of ovules per flower, and duration of the male phase, but pollen traits did not show a significant environmental main effect. The G × E interaction was significant for flower number, corolla size, nectar quality, duration of the male phase, pollen viability, and ovule number. The contribution of interaction variance to the total phenotypic variation (5-14%) was comparable to that of the environment alone (7-21%). Ovule number decreased in flowers on the upper part of the raceme by nearly 25%, but other traits did not vary significantly by floral position. These results suggest that (1) pollen traits are buffered against environmental change more than ovule number or other floral characters, (2) a male-female trade-off exists and is complicated by ontogenic factors, (3) G × E interactions are common but may have small effects, and (4) specific correlation patterns among floral traits can be dependent upon the environment under which they develop."

Finally, for the first time, studies ranging from the ecological to the molecular aspects of the same plastic response are available on insect and flowering plant model systems."

 "AbstractText": "Leguminous plants in symbiosis with rhizobia form either indeterminate nodules with a persistent meristem or determinate nodules with a transient meristematic region. Sesbania rostrata was thought to possess determinate stem and root nodules. However, the nature of nodule development is hybrid, and the early stages resemble those of indeterminate nodules. Here we show that, depending on the environmental conditions, mature root nodules can be of the indeterminate type. In situ hybridizations with molecular markers for plant cell division, as well as the patterns of bacterial nod and nif gene expression, confirmed the indeterminate nature of 30-day-old functional root nodules. Experimental data provide evidence that the switch in nodule type is mediated by the plant hormone ethylene."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Using degenerate oligonucleotides that correspond to conserved amino acid residues of known 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthases, we cloned a genomic fragment that encodes ACC synthase in Stellaria longipes. Southern analysis suggests that ACC synthase is encoded by a small gene family comprising about 4 members. We isolated four unique ACC synthase cDNA clones under different growth conditions from alpine and prairie ecotypes of S. longipes. Northern analyses suggest that ACC synthase genes are differentially and synergistically regulated by photoperiod and temperature. Such differential regulation of ACC synthase genes positively correlate with the levels of ACC and ethylene. Since ethylene has previously been shown to partly control the stem elongation plasticity in S. longipes, we propose that differential regulation of ACC synthase genes may represent one of the underlying molecular mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in S. longipes."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The plastic response of phenotypic traits to environmental change is a common research focus in several disciplines-from ecology and evolutionary biology to physiology and molecular genetics. The use of model systems such as the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana has facilitated a dialogue between developmental biologists asking how plasticity is controlled (proximate causes) and organismal biologists asking why plasticity exists (ultimate causes). Researchers studying ultimate causes and consequences are increasingly compelled to reject simplistic, 'black box' models, while those studying proximate causes and mechanisms are increasingly obliged to subject their interpretations to ecological 'reality checks.' We review the successful multidisciplinary efforts to understand the phytochrome-mediated shade-avoidance and light-seeking responses of flowering plants as a pertinent example of convergence between evolutionary and molecular biology. In this example, the two-way exchange between reductionist and holist camps has been essential to rapid and sustained progress. This should serve as a model for future collaborative efforts towards understanding the responses of organisms to their constantly changing environments."

 "AbstractText": "When measured directly, rather than inferred from pedigree analyses, the relationship between similarity in phenotype and similarity in DNA sequence was detectable at the level of members of a single population and strongly depended on the environmental context. Genetic divergence among 27 co-occurring genotypes of Abutilon theophrasti, a common annual plant, was less than 5 per cent as revealed by RAPD-PCR analysis based on over 400 bands per genotype. Nevertheless, within this narrow range, there was a positive correlation between genetic similarity and similarity in the performance of genotypes on temperature and moisture gradients, suggesting that plasticity itself has a genetic basis. No relationship was detected, however, when the phenotypic plasticity was expressed in response to gradients of light intensity or soil fertilization, indicating a weaker genetic basis, or suggesting possible involvement of a few genes of major effect."

 "AbstractText": "Burkholderia cepacia has attracted attention because of its extraordinary degradative abilities and its potential as a pathogen for plants and for humans. This bacterium was formerly considered to belong to the genus Pseudomonas in the gamma-subclass of the Proteobacteria, but recently has been assigned to the beta-subclass is based on rrn gene sequence analyses and other key phenotypic characteristics. The B. cepacia genome is comprised of multiple chromosomes and is rich in insertion sequences. These two features may have played a key role in the evolution of novel degradative functions and the unusual adaptability of this bacterium."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The study of the association between fitness and reaction norms is of primary importance given the hypothesized role for phenotypic plasticity in shaping evolutionary patterns: in microevolution, as one of mechanism for maintaining genetic variation, and in macroevolution, as a means of generating phenotypic novelties. In a glasshouse experiment, we investigated variation in reaction norms to nutrient availability in populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, and the relationship between this variation and reproductive fitness. We found evidence for across-treatment directional selection on the means for leaf number, flowering time, plant height, branching and growth rate; across-treatment stabilizing selection was detected for growth rate; and across-treatment disruptive selection was significant for leaf number. We also uncovered selection on the plasticity of some traits: directional for the plasticity of branching, and stabilizing for the plasticity of both branching and growth rate. When the two environments were considered separately, directional selection for height was detected under low nutrients; under high nutrients, we found evidence for directional selection on leaf number and height, and for disruptive selection on flowering time. The genetic correlation between a trait's expression in one environment and its expression in the alternate environment was positive and highly significant only for flowering time and growth rate. A principle components analysis revealed possible constraints on future selection responses, because of correlations among character means and among character plasticities."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Seasonal ecophysiology, leaf structure and nitrogen were measured in saplings of early (Populus grandidentata Michx. and Prunus serotina J.F. Ehrh.), middle (Fraxinus americana L. and Carya tomentosa Nutt.) and late (Acer rubrum L. and Cornus florida L.) successional tree species during severe drought on adjacent open and understory sites in central Pennsylvania, USA. Area-based net photosynthesis (A) and leaf conductance to water vapor diffusion (g(wv)) varied by site and species and were highest in open growing plants and early successional species at both the open and understory sites. In response to the period of maximum drought, both sunfleck and sun leaves of the early successional species exhibited smaller decreases in A than leaves of the other species. Shaded understory leaves of all species were more susceptible to drought than sun leaves and had negative midday A values during the middle and later growing season. Shaded understory leaves also displayed a reduced photosynthetic light response during the peak drought period. Sun leaves were thicker and had a greater mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen (N) content than shaded leaves, and early and middle successional species had higher N contents and concentrations than late successional species. In both sunfleck and sun leaves, seasonal A was positively related to predawn leaf Psi, g(wv), LMA and N, and was negatively related to vapor pressure deficit, midday leaf Psi and internal CO(2). Although a significant amount of plasticity occurred in all species for most gas exchange and leaf structural parameters, middle successional species exhibited the largest degree of phenotypic plasticity between open and understory plants."

"Pagination": {

},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Species that occupy large geographic ranges or a variety of habitats within a limited area deal with contrasting environmental conditions by genotypic and phenotypic variation. My students and I have studied these forms of ecophysiological variation in temperate tree species in eastern North America by means of a series of field and greenhouse experiments, including controlled studies with Cercis canadensis L., Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh., Acer rubrum L., Prunus serotina Ehrh. and Quercus rubra L., in relation to drought stress. These studies have included measurements of gas exchange, tissue water relations and leaf morphology, and have identified genotypic variation at the biome and individual community levels. Xeric genotypes generally had higher net photosynthesis and leaf conductance and lower osmotic and water potentials at incipient wilting than mesic genotypes during drought. Xeric genotypes also produced leaves with greater thickness, leaf mass per area and stomatal density and smaller area than the mesic genotypes, suggesting general coordination among leaf morphology, gas exchange and tissue water relations. Leaf phenotypic plasticity to different light environments occurred in virtually every study species, which represented a wide array of ecological tolerances. In a study of interactions of genotypes with environment, shade plants, but not sun plants, exhibited osmotic adjustment during drought and shade plants had smaller reductions in photosynthesis with decreasing leaf water potential. In that study, sun, but not shade, plants had significant genotypic differences in leaf structure, but with certain variables phenotypic variation exceeded genotype variation. Thus, genotypic variation was not expressed in all phenotypes, and phenotypes responded differentially to stress. Overall, these studies indicate the importance of genotypic and phenotypic variation as stress adaptations in temperate tree species among both distant and nearby sites of contrasting environmental conditions."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "The bacterial epiphyte Pseudomonas syringae MF714R was cultured on agar or in broth or collected from colonized leaves; it was then inoculated onto greenhouse-grown bean plants incubated in a growth chamber at low relative humidity or in the field or onto field-grown bean plants. Cells cultured in liquid medium survived the least well after inoculation of leaf surfaces under all conditions. Cells cultured in solid medium exhibited the highest percent survival and desiccation tolerance in the growth chamber but generally survived less well in the field than did cells harvested from plants. Cells harvested from plants and inoculated onto plants in the field usually exhibited the highest percent survival, started to increase in population earlier, and reached a higher number than did cells cultured in vitro. Differences in field survival were apparently not attributable to differential UV tolerance. The observed effects of phenotypic plasticity on epiphytic survival and colonization should be considered in risk assessment studies, in studies of bacterial epidemiology, and in the use of microbial antagonists for biological pest control."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "A collection of 75 putative mutants with alterations in leaf pigmentation was visually selected from Arabidopsis thaliana plants (M(2) generation) grown at 26 degrees C from seeds treated with the mutagen ethylmethanesulfonate. Fifty-eight of the plants were found to have chlorophyll contents decreased by at least 10% from the parental Columbia ecotype. These plants were screened for chlorophyll content and the ratio of chlorophyll b/a after growth at 20 or 26 degrees C. Relative to the parental type, a significant number of individuals in which the chlorophyll-deficient phenotype was exacerbated at one of the growth temperatures were identified. We conclude that temperature-sensitive phenotypic plasticity for chlorophyll content is relatively common in mutant populations of higher plants."

"Pagination": {

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "We produced earlier a monoclonal antibody against Schwann cell myelin protein (SMP), a glycoprotein expressed on Schwann cells (SC) but not on satellite cells of the ganglia or enteric glial cells. We now studied whether SMP expression is environmentally regulated in the different compartments of the peripheral nervous system. Quail neural-crest cells from either mes-metencephalic, vagal, or truncal levels of the neuraxis were heterochronically associated with gut wall, skin, or muscle tissues from embryonic day (E) 7 to E11 chickens. Coculture of these chimeric organs revealed that as in normal development glial cells, characterized by HNK1 immunoreactivity and the quail nuclear marker, expressed the SMP phenotype exclusively in skin and muscle, failing to do so in gut. However, when SMP+ SC from quail sciatic nerves were cocultured with chicken gut, these cells rapidly lost their initial SMP immunoreactivity. In contrast, when associated with muscle and skin, SC remained SMP+, even in the complete absence of neuronal cells. Enteric plexuses from E8 to E15 quail gut express SMP+ and laminin when withdrawn from the intestinal-mesenchyme environment. These results show that SMP can be expressed by enteric glial cells and that the SC SMP phenotype is strongly inhibited by the gut-wall environment. Moreover, these results strongly suggest that these two types of glial cells belong to the same lineage and that their terminal phenotype is modulated through cell-to-cell interactions."

"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "A collection of chlorophyll (Chl)-deficient mutants of sweetclover (Melilotus alba) with defects in eight nuclear loci were grown at 17 or 26 degrees C. Plants grown at either temperature were examined for Chl content, Chl a/b ratio, expression of the light-harvesting complex II (LHC-II) apoproteins, and protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) biosynthetic capacity. Except for the ch4 mutant, the parental strain and all mutants accumulate more Chl when grown at 26 degrees C than at 17 degrees C. The ch5 mutants, lacking Chl b under any growth condition, and the ch12 mutant showed little temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity, whereas this was a marked phenomenon in the other mutants. The ch10 and ch11 mutants demonstrated extreme temperature sensitivity with regard to the production of Chl b and the Chl b-binding LHC-II apoproteins. When excised trifoliolates were supplemented with exogenously supplied delta-aminolevulinic acid, only the ch4 mutant was markedly impaired in the ability to produce Pchlide. These data indicate that temperature-sensitive phenotypic plasticity is a common phenomenon of chlorphyll-deficient mutants and substantiate that only a minority of Chl-deficient mutants is impaired in the biosynthesis of Chl."

 "AbstractText": "Correlations between habitat and seed size suggest that this character is adaptive. Mean seed size is a relatively invariant species characteristic and seed size has marked effects upon fitness. These observations have previously led to the conclusion that seed size is under stabilizing selection. This conclusion, originally based mainly on evidence from crop plants grown in controlled environments, is questioned here on the grounds that recent studies of wild plants show marked phenotypic plasticity and low heritability of seed size. If seed size is not readily altered by natural selection in the wild, then its effects on fitness are evidence that this character is a constraint on habitat distribution. Constancy of mean seed size may be due to developmental canalization to a size set by previous selection, rather than a continuing process of stabilizing selection.",

"ArticleTitle": "Resource allocation under poor growth conditions. A major role for growth substances in developmental plasticity.",
"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "31-76" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "This article argues that the basic function for growth substance is resource allocation under poor growth conditions. The following scheme is suggested. Plants in the wild frequently suffer a paucity of resources which result from interplant competition and ecological and local environmental variation. The strategy adopted by many plants particularly ruderals (from which crops may have evolved) to help mitigate these problems is phenotypic plasticity; the growth of the plant body is adjusted to best exploit the scarce resources and help achieve desirable growth and reproductive goals. Phenotypic plasticity requires decisions to be made concerning the diversion of scarce growth resources to one facet of development rather than another; for example, to height or leaf area rather than thickness; or, between tissues, stem rather than leaves. Growth substances are coupled to these individual facets of development. They represent a simple way in which the extent of resource diversion can be controlled. Cells in specific tissues acquire sensitivity to particular growth substances at a stage in their development when environmental variability often necessitates choices to be made. This acquisition of ontogenetic sensitivity may be all or none. It may reflect acquisition of receptor proteins coupled to specific metabolic events. However in well-nourished plants these phases of development are relatively insensitive to changes in the level of the growth substance/receptor complex. Cells become more sensitive under certain well-defined but specific circumstances, characterized by the general term, poor growth conditions. These are produced by imbalances in one or more of the major environmental (nutritional) requirements for growth, light, nitrogen, water and oxygen. Imbalance in one or more of these produces characteristic and far-reaching metabolic and protein synthesis changes which normally constrain the synthetic processes for growth but amplify metabolic events coupled to growth substances. It is the function of growth substances to circumvent some of these metabolically constraining steps and by applying a constant stimulus to one specific aspect of growth or metabolism permit continued development. The additional input of growth substances into particular facets of development ensures the better maintenance (protection) of that character when competition for resources inside the plant is severe. However competition for scarce resources ensures that continuation of one growth aspect generally leads to relative depletion of others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

 "AbstractText": "Unicellular planktonic algae show considerable developmental plasticity in relation to mean cell size and the fraction of the cell volume occupied by various organelles. Changes in cell size and composition in relation to variations in the supply of light and nutrient solutes have been partially characterized with respect to the signals which regulate the changes, and in terms of the possible significance of the changes in maximizing growth rate under different resource-limited conditions. Less is known of the mechanisms by which the signals lead to the observed phenotypic effects. Multicellular attached macroalgae, whether acellular or multicellular, rhizophytic or haptophytic, have greater scope for phenotypic modification of morphology than do microalgae, in addition to the possibility of biochemical (compositional) changes. In addition to biochemical changes in response to variations in the ratio of availability of various resources (photons, N, P) there are also structural changes; significant here is the increased occurrence of (often colourless) hairs in haptophytes and (probably) of enhanced rhizoid development in rhizophytes. Many of the changes in morphology and physiology of macroalgae in response to changes in photon and nutrient supply have analogies in the behaviour of vascular plants (especially of aquatic vascular plants)."

 "AbstractText": "Plants possess biological and operational attributes that have encouraged geneticists to use them extensively in the development of fundamental genetic concepts. Attributes such as regenerative plasticity, high fecundity, cultural adaptability, range of ploidy, economics of culture and maintenance of specific populations, and versatility make plant genetic systems prime candidates with which to monitor the environment for mutagens. A specific locus (equivalent to a classical Mendelian gene) controls the development of a phenotypic characteristic. It can also mutate to a new allelic form with a consequentially altered phenotypic characteristic and can be separated by crossing over from adjacent loci that govern other specific phenotypic characteristics. Since various plant species have numerous specific loci, one has a rich array of potential systems from which to select. Specific locus systems in higher plants could be used to assess the mutagenicity of single chemical compounds or combinations of chemical compounds. Depending on the circumstances, seeds and/or seedlings could be used; plants could be grown in situ in either containers or plots to assess the immediate environment for one or more mutagens over an extended period. Since plants are eucaryotes, data from such experiments could serve as one more source of information along with that obtained from a battery of other tests used in the tier system."

"ArticleTitle": "Heritability analyses of IQ scores: science or numerology?",
"Pagination": {
 "MedlinePgn": "1259-66" 
},
"Abstract": {
 "AbstractText": "Estimates of IQ heritability are subject to a variety of systematic errors. The IQ scores themselves contain uncontrollable, systematic errors of unknown magnitude. These arise because IQ scores, unlike conventional physical and biological measurements, have a purely instrumental definition. The effects of these errors are apparent in the very large discrepancies among IQ correlations measured by different investigators. Genotype-environment correlations, whose effects can sometimes be minimized, if not wholly eliminated, in experiments with plants and animals, are nearly always important in human populations. The absence of significant effects arising from genotype-environment correlations is a necessary condition for the applicability of conventional heritability analysis to phenotypically plastic traits. When this condition fails, no quantitative inferences about heritability can be drawn from measured phenotypic variances and covariances, except under special conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied by phenotypically plastic traits in human populations. Inadequate understanding of the precise environmental factors relevant to the development of specific behavioral traits is an important source of systematic errors, as is the inability to allow adequately for the effects of assortative mating and gene-gene interaction. Systematic cultural differences and differences in psychological environment among races and among sociocco-nomic groups vitiate any attempt to draw from IQ data meaningful inferences about genetic differences. Estimates based on phenotypic correlations between separated monozygotic twins-usually considered to be the most reliable kind of estimates-are vitiated by systematic errors inherent in IQ tests, by the presence of genotype-environment correlation, and by the lack of detailed understanding of environmental factors relevant to the development of behavioral traits. Other kinds of estimates are beset, in addition, by systematic errors arising from incomplete allowance for the effects of assortative mating and from gene-gene interactions. The only potentially useful data are phenotypic correlations between unrelated foster children reared together, which could, in principle, yield lower limits for e(2). Available data indicate that, for unrelated foster children reared together, the broad heritability (h(2)) may lie between 0.0 and 0.5. This estimate does not apply to populations composed of children reared by their biological parents or by near relatives. For such populations the heritability of IQ remains undefined. The only data that might yield meaningful estimates ot narrow heritability are phenotypic correlations between half-sibs reared in statistically independent environments. No useful data of this kind are available. Intervention studies like Heber's Milwaukee Project afford an alternative and comparatively direct way of studying the plasticity of cognitive and other behavioral traits in human populations. Results obtained so far strongly suggest that the development of cognitive skills is highly sensitive to variations in environmental factors. These conclusions have three obvious implications for the broader issues mentioned at the beginning of this article. 1) Published analyses of IQ data provide no support whatever for Jensen's thesis that inequalities in cognitive performance are due largely to genetic differences. As Lewontin (8) has clearly shown, the value of the broad heritability of IQ is in any case only marginally relevant to this question. I have argued that conventional estimates of the broad heritability of IQ are invalid and that the only data on which potentially valid estimates might be based are consistent with a broad heritability of less than 0.5. On the other hand, intervention studies, if their findings prove to be replicable, would directly establish that, under suitable conditions, the offspring of parents whose cognitive skills are so poorly developed as to exclude them from all but the most menial occupations can achieve what are regarded as distinctly high levels of cognitive performance. Thus, despite the fact that children differ suibstantially in cognitive aptitudes and appetites, and despite the very high probability that these differences have a substantial genetic component, available scientific evidence strongly suggests that environmental factors are responsible for the failure of children not suffering from specific neurological disorders to achieve adequate levels of cognitive performance. 2) Under prevailing social conditions, no valid inferences can be drawn from IQ data concerning systematic genetic differences among races or socioeconomic groups. Research along present lines directed toward this end-whatever its ethical status-is scientifically worthless. 3) Since there are no suitable data for estimating the narrow heritability of IQ, it seems pointless to speculate about the prospects for a hereditary meritocracy based on IQ."
